<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Stamford was riding slowly, wearily
homeward in the late autumnal twilight along
the dusty track which led to the Windāhgil
station. The life of a pastoral tenant of the
Crown in Australia is, for the most part, free,
pleasant, and devoid of the cares which assail so
mordantly the heart of modern man in cities.</p>

<p class='c001'>But striking exceptions to this rule are
furnished periodically. “A dry season,” in the
bush vernacular, supervenes. In the drear
months which follow, “the flower fadeth, the
grass withereth” as in the olden Pharaoh days.
The waters are “forgotten of the footstep”;
the flocks and herds which, in the years of
plenty, afford so liberal an income, so untrammelled
an existence to their proprietor, are apt
to perish if not removed. Prudence and energy
may serve to modify such a calamity. No
human foresight can avert it.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>In such years, a revengeful person could
desire his worst enemy to be an Australian
squatter. For he would then behold him hardly
tried, sorely tormented, a man doomed to watch
his most cherished possessions daily fading
before his eyes; nightly to lay his head on his
pillow with the conviction that he was so much
poorer since sunrise. He would mark him day
by day, compelled to await the slow-advancing
march of ruin—hopeless, irrevocable—which he
was alike powerless to hasten or evade.</p>

<p class='c001'>If he were a husband and a father, his
anxieties would be ingeniously heightened and
complicated. The privations of poverty, the
social indignities which his loved ones might be
fated to undergo, would be forever in his
thoughts, before his eyes, darkening his melancholy
days, disturbing his too scanty rest.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was the present position, such were the
prospects, of Harold Stamford of Windāhgil.
As he rode slowly along on a favourite hackney—blood-like,
but palpably low in condition—with
bent head and corrugated brow, it needed
but little penetration to note that the “iron had
entered into his soul.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Truth to tell, he had that morning received
an important letter from his banker in Sydney.
Not wholly unexpected; still it had destroyed
the remnant of his last hope. Before its arrival
he had been manfully struggling against fate.
He had hoped against hope. The season might
change. How magical an alteration would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>forty-eight hours of steady rain produce! He
might be able to tide over till next shearing.
The station was being worked with the strictest
economy. How he grudged, indeed, the payment
of their wages to the men who performed
the unthankful task of cutting down the
<em>Casuarina</em> and <em>Acacia pendula</em>, upon which the
starving flocks were now in a great measure
kept alive!</p>

<p class='c001'>But for that abnormal expenditure, he and
his boy Hubert, gallant, high-hearted fellow
that he was, might make shift to do the station
work themselves until next shearing. How
they had worked, too, all of them! Had not
the girls turned themselves into cooks and
laundresses for weeks at a time! Had not his
wife (delicate, refined Linda Carisforth—who
would have thought to see a broom in those
hands?) worn herself well-nigh to death, supplementing
the details of household work, when
servants were inefficient, or, indeed, not to be
procured! And was this to be the end of all?
Of the years of patient labour, of ungrudging
self-denial, of so much care and forethought,
the fruit of which he had seen in the distance,
a modest competence, an assured position? A
well-improved freehold estate comprising the
old homestead, and a portion of the fertile lands
of Windāhgil, once the crack station of the
district, which Hubert should inherit after him.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was hard--very hard! As he came near
the comfortable, roomy cottage, and marked the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>orchard trees, the tiny vineyard green with
trailing streamers in despite of the weary,
sickening, cruel drought, his heart swelled nigh
to bursting as he thought how soon this ark of
their fortunes might be reft from them.</p>

<p class='c001'>Surely there must be some means of escape!
Providence would never be so hard! God’s
mercy was above all. In it he would trust
until the actual moment of doom. And yet,
as he marked the desolate, dusty waste across
which the melancholy flocks feebly paced; as
he saw on every side the carcases of animals
that had succumbed to long remorseless famine;
as he watched the red sun sinking below the
hard, unclouded sky, a sense of despair fell like
lead upon his heart, and he groaned aloud.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Hallo, governor!” cried out a cheery
voice from a clump of timber which he had
approached without observing, “you and old
Sindbad look pretty well told out! I thought
you were going to ride over me and the team,
in your very brown study. But joking apart,
dear old dad, you look awfully down on it.
Times are bad, and it’s never going to rain
again, is it? But we can’t afford to have you
throwing up the sponge. <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Fortuna favet
fortibus</em></span>, that’s our heraldic motto. Why, there
are lots of chances, and any amount of fortunes,
going begging yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Would you point out one or two of them,
Master Hubert?” said his father, relaxing his
features as he looked with an air of pride on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>the well-built youngster, who stood with bare
throat and sun-bronzed, sinewy arms beside a
dray upon which was a high-piled load of firewood.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, let us see! if the worst comes to
the worst, you and I must clear out, governor,
and take up this new Kimberley country. I’ve
got ten years’ work in me right off the reel.”
Here the boy raised his head, and stretched his
wide, yet graceful shoulders; “and so have
you, dad, if you wouldn’t fret so over what
can’t be helped. You’d better get home,
though, mother’s been expecting you this hour.
I’ll be in as soon as I’ve put on this last log.
This load ought to keep them in firewood for a
month.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“You’re a good boy, Hubert. I’ll ride on;
don’t knock any more skin off your hands than
is absolutely necessary, though,” pointing to a
bleeding patch about half an inch square, from
which the cuticle had been recently removed. “A
gentleman should consider his hands, even when
he is obliged to work. Besides, in this weather
there is a little danger of inflammation.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh, that!” said the youngster with the
fine carelessness of early manhood. “Scratches
don’t count in the bush. I wish my clothes
would heal of themselves when they get torn.
It would save poor mother’s everlasting stitch,
stitch, a little, and her eyes too, poor dear!
Now, you go on, dad, and have your bath, and
make yourself comfortable before I come in.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>A new magazine came by post to-day, and the
last <em>Australasian</em>. Laura’s got such a song too.
We’re going to have no end of an evening, if
you’ll only pull yourself together a bit. Now
you won’t fret about this miserable season, will
you? It’s bad enough, of course, but it’s no
use lying down to it—now, is it?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Right, my boy; we must all do our best,
and trust in God’s mercy. He has helped us
hitherto. It is cowardly to despair. I thank
Him that I have children whom I can be proud
of, whether good or ill fortune betide.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford put spurs to his horse. The
leg-weary brute threw up his head gamely, and,
true to his blood, made shift to cover the remaining
distance from the homestead at a brisk
pace. As he rode into the stable yard, a figure
clad in a jersey, a pair of trousers, and a bathing
towel, which turned out to be an eager lad of
twelve, ran up to him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Give me Sindbad, father; I’m just going
down to the river for a swim, and I’ll give him
one too. It will freshen him up. I’ll scrape
him up a bit of lucerne, just a taste; his chaff
and corn are in the manger all ready.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Take him, Dick; but don’t stay in too
long. It’s getting dark, and tea will soon be
ready.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The boy sprang into the saddle, and, touching
the old horse with his bare heels, started off on
a canter over the river meadow, now comparatively
cool in the growing twilight, towards a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>gravelly ford in which the mountain water still
ran strong and clear.</p>

<p class='c001'>With a sigh of relief, his father walked
slowly forward through the garden gate and
into the broad verandah of the cottage. Dropping
listlessly into a great Cingalese cane chair,
he looked round with an air of exhaustion and
despondency. Below him was a well-grown
orchard, with rows of fruit trees, the size and
spreading foliage of which showed as well great
age as the fertility of the soil. The murmuring
sound of the river over the rocky shallows was
plainly audible. Dark-shadowed eucalypti
marked its winding course. As the wearied
man lay motionless on the couch, the night air
from the meadow played freshly cool against his
temples. Stars arose of wondrous southern
brilliancy. Dark blue and cloudless, the sky
was undimmed. Strange cries came from the
woods. A solemn hush fell over all things. It
was an hour unspeakably calm and solemn—restful
to the spirit after the long, burdensome,
heated day.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah, me!” sighed he; “how many an
evening I have enjoyed from this very spot, at
this self-same hour! Is it possible that we are
to be driven out even from this loved retreat?”</p>

<p class='c001'>A sweet girlish voice suddenly awoke him
from his reverie, as one of the casement
windows opened, and a slight, youthful figure
stood at his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c001'>“No wonder you are ashamed, you mean old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>daddy! Here have mother and I been exerting
ourselves this hot afternoon to provide you with
a superior entertainment, quite a club dinner in
its way; attired ourselves, too, in the most
attractive manner—look at me, for instance—and
what is our reward? Why, instead of going
to dress sensibly, you sit mooning here, and
everything will be spoiled.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My darling! I am ready for my bath, I
promise you; but I am tired, and perhaps a little
discouraged. I have had a long day, and seen
nothing to cheer me either.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor old father! So have we all; so has
mother, so has Hubert, so have I and Linda.
But it’s no use giving in, is it? Now walk off,
there’s a dear! You’re not so very tired, unless
your constitution has broken down all of a
sudden. It takes a good day to knock you up,
that I know. But we must all put a good face
on it—mustn’t we?—till we’re <em>quite</em> sure that
the battle’s lost. The Prussians may come up
yet, you know!”</p>

<p class='c001'>He drew the girl’s face over to his own, and
kissed her fondly. Laura Stamford was indeed
a daughter that a father might proudly look
upon, that her mother might trust to be her
best aid and comfort, loving in prosperity,
lightsome of heart as the bird that sings at
dawn, brave in adversity, and strong to suffer
for those she loved.</p>

<p class='c001'>All innocent she of the world’s hard ways, its
lurid lights, its dread shadows. Proud, pure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>unselfish in every thought and feeling, all the
strength of her nature went out in fondness for
those darlings of her heart, the inmates of
that cherished home, wherein they had never as
yet known sorrow. The fateful passion which
makes or mars all womanhood was for her as yet
in the future. What prayers had ascended to
Heaven that her choice might be blessed, her
happiness assured!</p>

<p class='c001'>“This is the time for action, no more contemplation,”
she said, with a mock heroic air;
“the shower bath is filled; your evening clothes
are ready in the dressing-room; mother is
putting the last touch to her cap, Andiamo!”</p>

<p class='c001'>When the family met at the tea-table—a
comprehensive meal which, though not claiming
the rank of dinner, furnished most of its requisites—Mr.
Stamford owned that life wore a
brighter prospect.</p>

<p class='c001'>His wife and daughters in tasteful, though
not ostentatious, evening attire would have
graced a more brilliant entertainment. The
boys, cool and fresh after their swim in the
river, were happy and cheerful. Hubert,
correctly attired, and much benefited by his
bath and toilette, had done justice to his manifest
good looks.</p>

<p class='c001'>The well-cooked, neatly served meal, with
the aid of a few glasses of sound Australian
Reisling, was highly restorative. All these permissible
palliatives tended to recreate tone and
allay nervous depression. “The banker’s letter
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>notwithstanding, things might not be so very
bad,” the squatter thought. He would go to
town. He might make other arrangements.
It might even rain. If the worst came to the
worst, he might be able to change his account.
If things altered for the better, there was no use
desponding. If, again, all were lost, it were
better to confront fate boldly.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c001'>“Shall I pull through, after all?” said
Mr. Stamford to himself, for the fiftieth time,
as he looked over the morning papers at Batty’s
Hotel, about a week after the occurrences lately
referred to. In a mechanical way, his eyes and
a subsection of his brain provided him with the
information that, in spite of his misfortunes, the
progress of Australian civilisation went on
pretty much as usual. Floods in one colony,
fires in another. The Messageries steamer
<em>Caledonien</em> just in. The <em>Carthage</em> (P. and O.)
just sailed with an aristocratic passenger list.
Burglars cleverly captured. Larrikins difficult
of extinction. The wheat crop fair, maize only
so-so. These important items were registered
in the brooding man’s duplex-acting brain after
a fashion. But in one corner of that mysterious
store-house, printing machine, signal-station,
whatnot, <em>one thought</em> was steadily repeating itself
with bell-like regularity. “What if the bank’s
ultimatum is, no further advance, no further
advance, no further ad—--”</p>

<p class='c001'>After breakfast, sadly resolved, he wended his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>way to the palace of finance, with the potentate
of which he was to undergo so momentous an
interview.</p>

<p class='c001'>Heart-sick and apprehensive as he was, he
could not avoid noting with quick appreciation
the sights and sounds of civilisation which
pressed themselves on his senses as he walked in
a leisurely manner towards the Bank of New
Guinea. “What wonders and miracles daily
pass before one’s eyes in a city,” he said to
himself, “when one has been as long away from
town as I have! What a gallery of studies to
a man, after a quiet bush life, is comprised in
the everyday life of a large city! What processions
of humanity—what light and colour!
What models of art, strength, industry! What
endless romances in the faces of the very men
and women that pass and repass so ceaselessly!
Strange and how wonderful is all this!
Glorious, too, the ocean breath that fans the
pale faces of the city dwellers! What would I
not give for a month’s leisure and a quiet heart
in which to enjoy it all!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The solemn chime of a turret clock struck
ten. It aroused Stamford to a sense of the
beginning of the commercial day, and his urgent
necessity to face the enemy, whose outposts
were so dangerously near his fortress.</p>

<p class='c001'>The ponderously ornate outer door of the
Bank of New Guinea had but just swung open
as he passed in, preceding but by a second a
portly, silk-coated personage, apparently equally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>anxious for an early interview. He looked disappointed
as he saw Stamford make his way to
the manager’s room.</p>

<p class='c001'>For one moment he hesitated, then said: “If
your business is not important, sir, perhaps you
won’t mind my going in first?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I’m sorry to say it <em>is</em> important,” he replied,
with his customary frankness; “but I
will promise you not to take up a minute more
of Mr. Merton’s valuable time than I can
help.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The capitalist bowed gravely as Harold
Stamford passed into the fateful reception-room,
of which the very air seemed to him to be full
of impalpable tragedies.</p>

<p class='c001'>The manager’s manner was pleasant and
gentlemanlike. The weather, the state of the
country, and the political situation were glanced
at conversationally. There was no appearance
of haste to approach the purely financial topic
which lay so near the thoughts of both. Then
the visitor took the initiative.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I had your letter last week about my
account, Mr. Merton. What is the bank
going to do in my case? I came down on
purpose to see you.”</p>

<p class='c001'>The banker’s face became grave. It was the
crossing of swords, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en garde</em></span> as it were. And
the financial duel began.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I trust, Mr. Stamford, that we shall be able
to make satisfactory arrangements. You are an
old constituent, and one in whom the bank has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>reposed the fullest confidence; but,” here the
banker pushed up his hair, and his face assumed
an altered expression, “the directors have drawn
my attention to the state of your account, and
I feel called upon to speak decidedly. It must
be reduced.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But how am I to reduce it? You hold all
my securities. It is idle to talk thus; pardon
me if I am a little brusque, but I must sell
Windāhgil—sell the old place, and clear out
without a penny if I do not get time—a few
months of time—from the bank! You know
as well as I do that it is impossible to dispose
of stations now at a reasonable price. Why,
you can hardly get the value of the sheep!
Look at Wharton’s Bundah Creek how it was
given away the other day. Fifteen thousand
good sheep, run all fenced, good brick house,
frontage to a navigable river. What did it
bring? Six and threepence a head. Six and
threepence! With everything given in, even
to his furniture, poor devil! Why, the ewe
cost him twelve shillings, five years before.
Sale! It was a murder, a mockery! And is
Windāhgil to go like that, after all my hard
work? Am I and my children to be turned
out penniless because the bank refuses me
another year’s grace? The seasons are just as
sure to change as we are to have a new moon
next month. I have always paid up the interest
and part of the principal regularly, have I not?
I have lived upon so little too! My poor wife
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>and children for these last long years have been
so patient! Is there no mercy, not even
ordinary consideration to be shown me?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Mr. Stamford,” said the manager
kindly, “do not permit yourself to be excited
prematurely. Whatever happens you have my
fullest sympathy. If any one receives consideration
from the bank, you will do so. You
have done everything that an energetic, honourable
man could have done. I wish I could say
the same of all our constituents. But the
seasons have been against you, and you must
understand that, although personally I would
run any fair mercantile risk for your sake, even
to the extent of straining my relations with the
directors, I have not the power; I must obey
orders, and these are precise. If a certain
policy is decided upon by those who guide the
affairs of this company, I must simply carry
out instructions. Yours is a hard case, a <em>very</em>
hard case; but you are not alone, I can tell you
in confidence.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Is there nothing I can do?” pleaded the
ruined man, instinctively beholding the last
plank slipping from beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t give in yet,” said Merton kindly.
“Get one of these newly-started Mortgage and
Agency Companies to take up your account.
They have been organised chiefly, I am informed,
with a view to get a share of the
pastoral loan business, which is now assuming
such gigantic proportions. They are enabled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>to make easier terms than we can afford to do;
though, after all, this station pawn business is
not legitimate banking. If you have any friend
who would join in the security it would,
perhaps, smooth the way.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I will try,” said Stamford, a ray of hope,
slender but still definite, illumining the darkness
of his soul. “There may be a chance, and I
thank you, Mr. Merton, for the suggestion, and
your wish to aid me. Good morning!” He
took his hat and passed through the waiting-room,
somewhat sternly regarded by the
capitalist, who promptly arose as the inner door
opened. But Harold Stamford heeded him not,
and threading the thronged atrium, re-entered
once more the city pageant, novel and attractive
to him in spite of his misery. To-day he
mechanically took the seaward direction, walking
far and fast until he found himself among
the smaller shops and unmistakable “waterside
characters” of Lower George Street. Here he
remembered that there were stone stairs at
which, in his boyhood’s days, he had so often
watched the boats return or depart on their
tiny voyages. A low stone wall defended the
street on that side, while permitting a view of
the buildings and operations of a wharf.
Beyond lay the harbour alive with sail and
steam. In his face blew freshly the salt odours
of the deep, the murmuring voice of the sea
wave was in his ears, the magic of the ocean
stole once more into his being.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>In his youth he had delighted in boating, and
many a day of careless, unclouded joy could he
recall, passed amid the very scenes and sounds
that now lay around him. Long, happy days
spent in fishing when the fair wind carried the
boy sailors far away through the outer bays or
even through the grand portals where the sandstone
pillars have borne the fret of the South
Pacific deep for uncounted centuries. The long
beat back against the wind, the joyous return,
the pleasant evening, the dreamless slumber.
He remembered it all. What a heaven of
bliss, had he but known it; and what an inferno
of debt, ruin, and despair seemed yawning
before him now!</p>

<p class='c001'>He leaned over the old stone wall and
watched mechanically the shadow of a passing
squall deepen the colour of the blue waters of
the bay. After a while, his spirits rose
insensibly. He even took comfort from the
fact that after the sudden tempest had brooded
ominously over the darkening water, the clouds
suddenly opened—the blue sky spread itself like
an azure mantle over the rejoicing firmament—the
golden sun reappeared, and Nature assumed
the smile that is rarely far from her brow in
the bright lands of the South.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I may have another chance yet,” Stamford
said to himself. “Why should I despair?
Many a man now overladen with wealth has
passed into a bank on such an errand as mine,
uncertain whether he should return (financially)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>alive. Are not there Hobson, Walters, Adamson—ever
so many others—who have gone
through that fiery trial? I must fight the
battle to the end. My Waterloo is not yet
lost. ‘The Prussians may come up,’ as darling
Laura said.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Although receiving the advice of Mr.
Merton, whom he personally knew and
respected, mainly in good faith, he was
sufficiently experienced in the ways of the world
to mingle distrust with his expectations. It
was not such an unknown thing with bankers to
“shunt” a doubtful or unprofitable constituent
upon a less wary student of finance. Might it
not be so in this case? Or would not the
manager of the agency company indicated
regard him in that light? How hard it was to
decide! However, he would try his fortune.
He could do himself no more harm.</p>

<p class='c001'>So he turned wearily from the dancing waters
and the breezy bay, and retracing his steps
through the crowded thoroughfare, sought the
imposing freestone mansion in which were
located the offices of the Austral Agency Company.</p>

<p class='c001'>“How these money-changing establishments
house themselves!” he said. “And we borrowers
pay for it with our heart’s blood,” he
added, bitterly. “Here goes, however!”</p>

<p class='c001'>He was not doomed on this occasion to any
lingering preparatory torture, for in that light
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>he had come to regard all ante-chamber detentions.
He accepted it as a good omen that
he was informed on sending in his card, that
Mr. Barrington Hope was disengaged, and
would be found in his private room.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER II</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Stamford was at once strongly prepossessed
in favour of the man before whom he
had come prepared to make a full statement of
his affairs, and to request—to all but implore—temporary
accommodation. Bah! how bald a
sound it had! How unpleasant the formula!
And yet Harold Stamford knew that the
security was sound, the interest and principal
nearly as certain to be paid in full as anything
can be in this uncertain world of ours. Still,
such was the condition of the money market
that he could not help feeling like a beggar.
His pride rebelled against the attitude which he
felt forced to take. Nevertheless, for the sake
of the sweet, careworn face at home, the tender
flowerets he loved so well, he braced himself for
the ordeal.</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Barrington Hope’s appearance, not less
than his manner, was reassuring. A tall, commanding
figure of the true Anglo-Saxon type,
his was a countenance in which opposing
qualities seemed struggling for the mastery.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>In the glint of the grey eyes, in the sympathetic
smile, in the deep, soft voice there was a
wealth of generosity, while the firm mouth
and strongly set jaw betokened a sternness of
purpose which boded ill for the adversary in any
of the modern forms of the duello—personal or
otherwise.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Mr. Stamford,” he said, “I have heard
your name mentioned by friends. What can I
do for you? But if it be not a waste of time
in your case—though you squatters are not so
hard-worked in town as we slaves of the desk—we
might as well lunch first, if you will give me
the pleasure of your company at the Excelsior.
What do you say?”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford, in his misery, had taken scant
heed of the hours. He was astonished to find
that the morning had fled. He felt minded to
decline, but in the kindly face of his possible
entertainer he saw the marks of continuous
mental exertion, mingled with the easily-recognised
imprints of anxious responsibility. A
feeling of sadness came over him, as he looked
again—of pity for the ceaseless toil to which it
seemed hard that a man in the flower of his
prime should be doomed—that unending mental
grind, of which he, in common with most men
who have lived away from cities, had so cordial
an abhorrence. “Poor fellow!” he said to himself,
“he is not more than ten years older than
Hubert, and yet what an eternity of thought
seems engraven in his face. I should be sorry to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>see them change places, poor as we are, and
may be.” He thought this in the moment
which he passed in fixing his eyes on the
countenance of Barrington Hope. What he
said, was: “I shall have much pleasure; I
really did not know it was so late. My time in
town, however, is scarcely so valuable as yours.
So we may as well devote half an hour to the
repairing of the tissue.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford’s wanderings in Lower George
Street and the unfamiliar surroundings of the
metropolis had so far overcome the poignancy
of his woe as to provide him with a reasonable
appetite. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>cuisine</em></span> of the Excelsior, and
the flavour of a bottle of extremely sound Dalwood
claret, did not appeal to his senses in vain.
The well-cooked, well-served repast concluded,
he felt like another man; and though distrusting
his present sensations as being artificially
rose-coloured, he yet regarded the
possibility of life more hopefully.</p>

<p class='c001'>“It has done me good,” he said in his heart;
“and it can’t have done him any harm. I feel
better able to stand up to hard Fate and her
shrewd blows than before.”</p>

<p class='c001'>They chatted pleasantly till the return to the
office, when Mr. Hope hung up his hat, and
apparently removed a portion of his amiability
of expression at the same time. He motioned
his visitor to a chair, produced a box of cigars,
which, with a grotesque mediæval matchbox, he
pushed towards him. Lighting one for himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>he leaned back in his chair and said “Now then
for business!”</p>

<p class='c001'>The squatter offered a tabulated statement,
originally prepared for the bank, setting forth
the exact number of the livestock on Windāhgil,
their sexes and ages, the position and area of
the run, the number of acres bought, controlled
or secured; the amount of debt for which the
bank held mortgage, the probable value of the
whole property at current rates. Of all of
which particulars Mr. Hope took heed closely
and carefully. Mr. Stamford became suddenly
silent, and indeed broke down at one stage of
the affair, in which he was describing the value
of the improvements, and mentioning a comfortable
cottage, standing amid a well-grown
orchard on the bank of a river, with out-buildings
of a superior nature grouped around.</p>

<p class='c001'>Then Mr. Hope interposed. “You propose
to me to take up your account, which you will
remove from the Bank of New Guinea. You
are aware that there is considerable risk.”</p>

<p class='c001'>(“Hang it!” Mr. Stamford told himself;
“I have heard that surely before. I know what
you are going to say now. But why do you
all, you financiers, like to keep an unlucky devil
so on the tenter-hooks?”)</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Hope went on quietly and rather
sonorously. “Yes! there has been a large
amount of forced realisation going on of late.
Banks are tightening fast. The rainfall of the
interior has been exceptionally bad. I think it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>probable that the Bank of New Guinea has none
too good an opinion of your account. But I
always back my own theory in finance. I have
great reason to believe, Mr. Stamford, that
heavy rain will fall within the next month or
two. I have watched the weather signs carefully
of late years. I am taking—during this
season, at any rate—a strong lead in wool and
stock, which I expect to rise. Everything is
extremely low at present—ruinously so, the
season disastrously dry. But from these very
dry seasons I foretell a change which must be
for the better. I have much pleasure in stating
that the Austral Agency Company will take up
your account, Mr. Stamford, and carry you on
for two years at the same rate of interest you
have been paying.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford made a commencement of
thanking him, or at least of expressing his
entire satisfaction with the new arrangement;
but, curious to relate, he could not speak. The
mental strain had been too great. The
uncertain footing to which he had so long been
clinging between ruin and comparative safety
had rendered his brain dizzy.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had been afraid to picture the next scene
of the tragedy, when the fatal fiat of the Bank
Autocrat should have gone forth,—the wrench
of parting from the dear old place they had all
loved so well. The unpretending, but still
commodious dwelling to which he had brought
his fond, true wife, while yet a young mother.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>The garden in which they had planted so many
a tree, so many a flower together. The
unchecked freedom of station life, with its
general tone of abundance and liberality. All
these surroundings and comforts were to be
exchanged—if things were not arranged—for
what? For a small house in town, for a lower—how
much lower!—standard of life and society,
perhaps even for poverty and privation, which
it would cut him to the heart to see shared by
those patient exiles from their pastoral Eden.</p>

<p class='c001'>When Mr. Stamford had sufficiently recovered
himself he thanked Mr. Hope with somewhat
unaccustomed fervour, for he was an undemonstrative
man, reserved as to his deeper feelings.
But the manager of the Austral Agency
Company would not accept thanks. “It may
wear the appearance of a kindness, but it is
not so in reality,” he said. “Do not mistake
me. It is a hard thing to say, but if it seemed
such to me, it would be my duty not to do it.
It is the merest matter of calculation. I am
glad, of course, if it falls in with your
convenience.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here he looked kindly at his client—for such
he had become—as if he fain would have convinced
him of his stern utilitarian temperament.
But, as he had remarked before, Mr. Hope’s
eyes and his sentiments contradicted one another.</p>

<p class='c001'>“You have saved my home, the valued outcome
of many a year’s hard work—it may be
my life also. That is all. And I’m not to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>thank you? Do not talk in so cold-blooded a
manner; I cannot bear it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear sir,” said Mr. Hope, with calm,
half-pitying expression, “I am afraid you are
not a particularly good man of business. It is
as unfair to praise me now for ‘carrying you
on’ for another year or two, as it will be to
blame me for selling you up some fine day, if
I am compelled to do so.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Anyhow, it is a reprieve from execution.
When shall I call again?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To-morrow morning, before twelve, let us
say. I shall want you to sign a mortgage—a
necessary evil; and if you bring me an exact
amount of your indebtedness to the Bank of
New Guinea, I will give you a cheque for it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A cheque for it!” How magnificent was
the sound. Mr. Stamford had drawn some
tolerably large cheques in his time, which had
been duly honoured, but of late years the
cheque-drawing method had fallen much into
abeyance.</p>

<p class='c001'>Nevertheless, he felt like Aladdin, suddenly
gifted with the wonderful lamp. The sense of
security and the guarantee of funds, for even
their moderate and necessary expenses, appeared
to open to him vistas of wealth and power
verging on Oriental luxury.</p>

<p class='c001'>He lost no time; indeed he just managed to
gain his bank before its enormous embossed
outer door was closed, when he marched into
the manager’s room with so radiant a countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>that the experienced centurion of finance
saw plainly what had happened.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t trouble yourself to speak,” he said.
“It’s all written on your forehead. We bankers
can decipher hieroglyphs invisible to other men.
‘Want my account made up—securities
ready to be delivered—release—cheque for
amount in full.’ Who is the reckless <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>entrepreneur</em></span>?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“The Austral Agency Company,” he replied,
feeling rather cooled down by this very
accurate mind-reading; “but you seem to know
so much, you ought to know that too.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear fellow, I congratulate you!” Mr.
Merton said, getting up and shaking him warmly
by the hand. “I beg your pardon; but really,
any child could see that you had been
successful; and I began to think that it must
have been one of Barrington Hope’s long
shots. A very fine fellow, young but talented;
in finance operates boldly. I don’t say he’s
wrong, mind you, but rather bold. Everything
will be ready for you to-morrow morning. Look
in just before ten—by the private door.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford did look in. How many times
had he walked to those same bank doors with an
aching heart, in which the dull throb of conscious
care was rarely stilled! Many times had he
quitted that building with a sense of temporary
relief; many times with a more acutely
heightened sense of misery, and a conviction
that Fate had done her worst. But never,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>perhaps, before had he passed those fateful portals
with so marked a sense of independence and
freedom as on the present occasion.</p>

<p class='c001'>He had cast away the burden of care, at any
rate for two years—two whole years! It was
an eternity in his present state of overwrought
feeling. He felt like a man who in old days
had been bound on the rack—had counted the
dread contrivances for tearing muscles and
straining sinews—who had endured the first
preliminary wrench, and then, at a word, was
suddenly loosed.</p>

<p class='c001'>Such was now his joyous relief from inward
agony, from the internal throbs which rend the
heart and strain to bursting the wondrous tissue
which connects soul and sense. The man who
had decreed all this was to him a king—nay, as
a god. And in his prayer that night, after he
had entreated humbly for the welfare of wife
and children in his absence, and for his own safe
return to their love and tenderness, Barrington
Hope came after those beloved names, included
in a petition for mercy at the hands of the All-wise.</p>

<p class='c001'>It was not a long business that clearing of
scores with the Bank of New Guinea under
these exceptional circumstances. Such and such
was the debit balance, a sufficiently grave one in
a season when it had not rained, “to signify,”
for about three years, when stock was unsalable,
when money was unprecedentedly tight, but not,
perhaps amounting to more than one-third of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>the real value of the property. Here were the
mortgages. One secured upon the freehold, the
other upon stock and station, furniture and
effects.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes!” admitted Mr. Stamford, looking
over it. “It is a comprehensive document; it
includes everything on the place—the house and
all that therein is, every hoof of stock, hacks
and harness horses, saddles and bridles—only
excepting the clothes on our backs. Good God!
if we had lost all! And who knows whether
we may not have to give them up yet.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dear Stamford,” said the banker,
“you’re almost too sentimental to be a squatter,
though I grant you it requires a man of no
ordinary power of imagination to look forward
from your dusty pastures and dying sheep (as I
am informed) to a season of waving grass and
fat stock. Why only this morning, I see that
on Modlah, North Queensland, they have lost
eighty thousand sheep already!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“That means they’ll have a flood in three
months,” answered Stamford, forcing a laugh.
“We <em>must</em> have rain. This awfully sultry
weather is sure to bring it on sooner or later.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Ah! but when?” said Mr. Merton, corrugating
his brow, as he mentally ran over the
list of heavily-weighted station accounts to
which this simple natural phenomenon would
make so stupendous a difference. “If you or
I could tell whether it would fall in torrents
this year or next, it would be like—--”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>“Like spotting the winner of the Melbourne
Cup before the odds began to shorten—eh,
Merton? Good Heavens! to think I feel in a
mood to jest with my banker. That dread
functionary! What is it Lever says—that
quarrelling with your wife is like boxing with
your doctor, who knows where to plant the
blow that would, maybe, be the death of you?
Such is your banker’s fatal strength.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I envy you your recovered spirits, my dear
fellow,” said the over-worked man of figures,
with a weary smile, glancing towards a pile of
papers on his table. “Perhaps things will turn
out well for you and all of us after all. You
are not the only one, believe me, whose fate has
been trembling in the balance. You don’t think
it’s too pleasant for us either, do you? Well,
I’ll send young Backwater down to Barrington
Hope with these documents. You can go with
him, and he will give a receipt for the cheque.
For the rest, my congratulations and best
wishes.” He pressed an electric knob, the door
opened, a clerk looked in. “Tell Mr. Overdue
I am at liberty now. Good bye, Stamford, and
God bless you!”</p>

<p class='c001'>On the previous day Mr. Stamford had betaken
himself to his hotel immediately after
quitting Mr. Barrington Hope’s office, and
poured out his soul with fullest unreserve in a
long letter to his wife, in which he had informed
her of the great and glorious news, and with his
usual sanguine disposition to improve on each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>temporary ray of sunshine, had predicted wonders
in the future.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What my present feelings are, even you, my
darling Linda—sharer that you have ever been
in every thought of my heart—can hardly realise.
I know that you will say that only the present
pressure is removed. The misfortune we have
all so long, so sadly dreaded, which involves the
loss of our dear old home, the poverty of our
children, and woe unutterable for ourselves, may
yet be slowly advancing on us. You hope I will
be prudent, and take nothing for granted until
it shall have been proved. I am not to relax
even the smallest endeavour to right ourselves,
or suffer myself to be led into any fresh expense,
no matter how bright, or rather (pastoral joke
of the period) how cloudy, the present outlook,
till rain comes—until rains comes; even then to
remember that there is lost ground to recover,
much headway to make up.</p>

<p class='c001'>“My dearest, I am as sure that you have got
all these warning voices ready to put into your
letter as if you phonographed them, and I recognised
the low, sweet tones which have ever
been for me so instinct with love and wisdom.
But I feel that, on this present occasion—(I hear
you interpose, ‘My dearest Harold, how often
have you said so before!’)—there is no need for
any extraordinary prudence. I am confident that
the season will change, or that something advantageous
will happen long before this new advance
is likely to be called in. Mr. Hope assures me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>that no sudden demand will at any time be made,
that all reasonable time will be given; that if
the interest be but regularly paid, the Company
is in a position, from their control of English
capital, to give better terms than any colonial
institution of the same nature. I see you shake
your wise, distrustful head. My dearest, you
women, who are said to be gifted with so much
imagination in many ways, possess but little in
matters of business. I have often told you so.
This time I hope to convince you of the superior
forecast of our sex.</p>

<p class='c001'>“And now give my love to our darlings. Tell
them I shall give practical expression to my fondness
for them for this once, only this once; really,
I must be a little extravagant. I shall probably
stay down here for another week or ten days.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Now that I am in town I may just as well
enjoy myself a little, and get up a reserve fund
of health and strength for future emergencies.
I don’t complain, as you know, but I think I
shall be all the better for another week’s sea air.
I met my cousin, Bob Grandison, in the street
to-day. Kind as usual, though he studiously
avoided all allusion to business; wanted me to
stay at Chatsworth House for a few days. I
wouldn’t do that. I don’t care for Mrs.
Grandison sufficiently; but I am going to a
swell dinner there on Friday. And now, dearest,
yours ever and always, fondly, lovingly,
<span class='sc'>Harold Stamford</span>.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Having sent off this characteristic epistle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Mr. Stamford felt as easy in his mind as if he
had provided his family with everything they
could possibly want for a year. He was partially
endowed with that Sheridanesque temperament
which dismissed renewed acceptances as
liabilities discharged, and viewed all debentures
as debts of the future which a kindly Providence
might be safely trusted to find means to pay.</p>

<p class='c001'>Capable of extraordinary effort under pressure
or the excitement of emergency; personally
economical; temperate, and, above all, benevolent
of intention towards every living creature,
it must be admitted that Harold Stamford was
instinctively prone frankly to enjoy the present
and to take the future on trust.</p>

<p class='c001'>Much of this joyous confidence had been
“knocked out of him”—as he familiarly
phrased it—by the austere course of events.
He had for five years worked harder than any
of his own servants. He had contented himself
with but the bare necessaries of food and clothing.
Nothing had been purchased that could
in any way be done without by that much-enduring,
conscientious household, the members
of which had made high resolve to do battle
with remorseless Nature and unmerited misfortune.</p>

<p class='c001'>And well indeed had all fought, all endured,
during the long, dreary, dusty summers—the
cloudless, mocking, rainless winters of past
years. The family garrison had stood to their
guns; had not given back an inch. The men
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>had toiled and ridden, watched and worked,
from earliest dawn to the still, starlit depths of
many a midnight. The tenderly-nurtured
mother and her fair, proud girls had cooked the
dinners, washed the clothes, faithfully performed
all, even the humblest, household work, with
weary hands and tired eyes, for weeks and
months together. Still, through all the uncongenial
drudgery, their hearts had been firm
with hope and the pride of fulfilled duty. And
now Harold Stamford told himself that the
enemy was in retreat, that the siege was about
to be raised.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Stamford, having fulfilled his home
duties temporarily in this liberal and satisfactory
manner, felt himself at liberty to enter
upon justifiable recreations with an easy conscience.
He was by no means a person of
luxurious tastes. But there had been always
certain dainty meats, intellectually speaking,
which his soul loved. These are rarely to be
met with save in large cities. It had been an
abiding regret with this man that his narrow
circumstances had shut him out from the inner
circles of art and literature. Now, he promised
himself, at any rate, a taste of these long-forbidden
repasts.</p>

<p class='c001'>On this memorable afternoon he betook himself
only to the sea-marge, where he lay dreaming
in the shade of an overhanging fig-tree
during the closing hours of day. What an
unutterable luxury was it to his desert-worn
soul thus to repose with the rhythmic roll of
the surges in his ear—before his half-shut eyes
the wondrous, ever-changing magic mirror of
the ocean!</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>“What an alteration,” thought he, “had a
single day wrought in his destiny! What a
different person was he from the care-burdened,
desponding man who had seen no possible outlet
from the path of sorrow and disaster, at the end
of which lay the grisly form of Ruin, like some
fell monster watching for prey. Now the airs
of Paradise were around him. The fresh salt
odours of the deep, the whispering breezes which
fanned his cheek, which cooled his throbbing
brow, how strangely contrasted were these surroundings
with the shrivelled, arid waste, the
burning sun-blast, the endless monotony of pale-hued
woodland, which he had so lately quitted!”</p>

<p class='c001'>As the low sun fell beneath the horizon verge,
he watched the golden wavelet and the crimson
sky mingle in one supreme colour study. He
heard the night wind come moaning up from
misty unknown seas of the farthest South, where
the hungry billow lay hushed to rest in eternal
ice-fields, where dwelt the mystery and dread of
polar wastes.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c001'>Then, with the darkening eve, the pageant
glided into the vestibule of night and Mr. Stamford
somewhat hastily arose, bethinking himself
of the dining hour at Chatsworth House. He
had not overmuch time to spare, but a few
minutes before the appointed hour his cab
deposited him beside the Pompeian mosaic
which composed the floor of the portico. A
wide, cool hall, gay with encaustic tiles, received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>him, thence to be ushered by the accurately-costumed
footman into the drawing-room, already
fairly astir with the expected company.</p>

<p class='c001'>He was not an unfamiliar guest, but his present
temper inclined him to consider more closely
the curious inequalities of life—the various
modes in which persons, not widely differing
in tastes and aspirations, are socially encircled.
What a contrast was there between the abounding
luxury here heaped up, pressed down and
running over, and the homely surroundings of
his own home, from which nevertheless the
danger of departure had well-nigh driven him
mad. The parquet floors, the glittering treasures
of the overmantels, the lounges, the dado,
the friezes, the rare china, the plaques, the
antique and the modern collections, each a
study, the cost of which would have gone nigh
to buy halt Windāhgil.</p>

<p class='c001'>When the hostess was informed by the imposing
butler that dinner was served, and the guests
filed into the dining-room, Mr. Stamford was
nearly as much astonished by the magnificence
of the repast and the concomitants thereof as if
he had for the first time in his life beheld
such splendours. In earlier days, now almost
forgotten, such repasts had been to him sufficiently
familiar. But these latter seasons of
drought and despair had wholly, or in great
part, excluded all thought of the pomps and
vanities of life. So he smiled to himself, as he
took the arm of Miss Crewit the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>passée</em></span> society
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>damsel to whom, by the fiat of Mrs. Grandison,
he had been allotted, to find that his first thought
was of startled surprise—his second of the habitudes
which came to him as by second nature,
and a conviction that he must have witnessed
such presentments in a former state of existence.</p>

<p class='c001'>All was very splendid, beyond denial. What
was otherwise was æsthetically rare and almost
beyond price. Antique carved furniture, mediæval
royal relics, a sideboard which looked
like an Egyptian sarcophagus, contrasted effectively
with the massiveness of the plate, the
glory of the glass, the triumph of the matchless
Sèvres dinner-service. In perfect keeping was
the quiet assiduity of the attendants, the quality
of the iced wines, the perfection and finish of
the whole entertainment.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Rather a contrast to the tea-table at
Windāhgil!” Harold Stamford said to himself;
“not but what I should have been able to do
things like this if I could have held on to those
Kilbride blocks for another year. Only another
year!” and he sighed involuntarily. “It is
very fine in its way, though I should be sorry
to have to go through this ordeal every evening.
Grandison doesn’t look too happy making conversation
with that deaf old dowager on his
right. He was brighter looking in the old
working-time, when he used to drop in at Din
Din, where we had a glass of whisky before bedtime
with a smoke and a good talk afterwards.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Bob certainly read more or less then. He
begins to look puffy too; he doesn’t see much
of the library now, I’m afraid, except to snore
in it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Here his fair neighbour, who had finished her
soup and sipped her sherry, began to hint an
assertion of social rights.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Don’t you think dear Josie looks a little
pale and thin, though she is exquisitely dressed
as usual? But I always say no girls can stand
the ceaseless excitement, the wild racketing of a
Sydney season. Can they, now?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“To my eye she looks very nice, pale if you
like; but you don’t expect roses and lilies with
the thermometer at 80° for half the year, except
when it’s at 100°.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, perhaps you’re right; but it isn’t the
climate altogether in her case, I should say.
It’s the fearfully exciting life girls of her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>monde</em></span>
seem to lead nowadays. It’s that which brings
on the wrinkles. You notice her face when she
turns to the light.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Are women worse than they used to be, do
you think; or is Josie more dissipated than the
rest of her age and sex?” queried Stamford.</p>

<p class='c001'>“I don’t know that, though they do say that
she is the fastest of a very fast set; and between
you and me, there have been some rather queer
stories about her, not that I believe a word of
them. But the girls nowadays do go such awful
lengths; they say and do such things, you don’t
know <em>what</em> to believe.”</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Ah! well, she’s young and happy, I suppose,
and makes the most of her opportunities of
enjoyment. My old friend, Bob Grandison, has
been lucky, and his family seem to have everything
they can possibly want.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Everything, indeed, and more besides.
(Chablis, if you please!) Then I suppose you
knew Mr. Grandison when he was not quite so
well off? They say he got into society rather
suddenly; but I’m afraid it doesn’t do the
young people quite as much good as it might.
There’s the eldest son, Carlo, as they call him—he
used to be Charlie when I first knew them.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Why, what about him? Nothing wrong, is
there? He seems a fine lad.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, nothing wrong yet. Not yet; oh,
no! Only he spends half his time at the club,
playing billiards from morning till night, and
he’s always going about with that horrid gambling
Captain Maelstrom. They do say—but you
won’t let it go further—that he was one of that
party at loo when young Weener lost five
thousand pounds, and such a scandal arose out
of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Good heavens! You horrify me! A mere
boy like that! It can’t be true; surely not.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I heard it on good authority, I assure you,
and other stories too, which I can’t repeat—really
too shocking to talk about. See how
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>empresse</em></span> he is with that Mrs. Loreleigh! What
men see in that women I really can’t think.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“My old friend had both sense and right
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>feeling once upon a time,” said Stamford.
“He can’t be so weak as to allow all this.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“He does all he can, poor old gentleman;
but Mrs. Grandison is so absurdly vain about
Carlo’s good looks, and the fine friends he goes
about with, that she can’t see any danger.
Lord Edgar Wildgrave and that Sir Harry
Falconer who was here last year (you know they
do say that Josie broke her heart about Lord
Edgar, and that makes her so reckless). But I
know his father is very uneasy about him, and
well he may be. I’m afraid Ned bids fair to
follow in his brother’s footsteps. Thanks—I
will take an olive.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a wretched state of things!” groaned
Mr. Stamford, almost audibly. “I must hope,
for the sake of my friend’s family, that matters
may be exaggerated.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I wish they are, with all my heart,” said the
candid friend. “They always have such
delicious fruit here, haven’t they? I must say
they do things well at Chatsworth House. I
always enjoy a dinner here. I see Mrs.
Grandison making a move. Thanks!”</p>

<p class='c001'>And so Miss Crewitt followed the retreating
file of ladies that, headed by Mrs. Grandison’s
stately form, quitted the dining-room, leaving
Mr. Stamford much disordered with the unpleasant
nature of the ideas which he had perforce
absorbed with his dinner. He could not forgive
his late neighbour for introducing them into his
system.</p>

<p class='c001'><span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>“Confounded, venomous, ungrateful cat!”
he said in his righteous wrath. “How she enjoyed
every mouthful of her dinner, pouring out
malice and all uncharitableness the while!
Serves Mrs. Grandison right, all the same. If
she’d picked me out a nice girl, or a good
motherly dame, I should not have heard all
this scandal about her household. But what a
frightful pity it seems! I must talk to Grandison
about it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>At this stage Mr. Stamford was aroused by
his host’s voice. “Why, Harold, old man, where
have you got to? Close up, now the women are
gone. Bring your chair next to Carlo.”</p>

<p class='c001'>He walked up as desired, the other guests
having concentrated themselves in position
nearer the head of the table, and found himself
next to the heir of the house, Mr. Carlo
Grandison. That young gentleman, whom he
had observed during dinner talking with earnestness
to a lady no longer young, but still handsome
and interesting, in spite of Miss Crewitt’s
acidulated denial of the fact, did not trouble
himself to be over agreeable to his father’s
old friend.</p>

<p class='c001'>He devoted himself, however, with considerable
assiduity to the decanters as they passed,
and drank more wine in half an hour than Mr.
Stamford had ever known Hubert to consume
in a month.</p>

<p class='c001'>He did talk after a while, but his conversation
was mainly about the last Melbourne Cup, upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>which he admitted that he had wagered heavily,
and “dropped in for,” to use his own expression,
“a beastly facer.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Was not that imprudent?” asked Mr.
Stamford, as he looked sadly at the young man’s
flushed face. “Don’t you think it a pity to lose
more than you can afford?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Oh! the governor had to stand the racket,
of course,” he said, filling his glass; “and a
dashed row he made about it—very bad form, I
told him—just as if a thousand or two mattered
to him. Do you know what we stood to win?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, but you didn’t win!”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I suppose in the bush, Mr. Stamford, you
don’t do much in that way,” answered the young
man with aristocratic hauteur, “but Maelstrom
and I, Sir Harry Falconer and another fellow,
whose name I won’t mention, would have pulled
off forty-five thousand if that infernal First
Robber hadn’t gone wrong the very day of the
race. Think of that! He was poisoned, I
believe. If I had my will I’d hang every
blessed bookmaker in the whole colony. Never
mind, I’ll land them next Melbourne Spring.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“If there were no young gentlemen who
backed the favourite, there would be fewer
bookmakers,” replied Stamford, peaceably.
“But don’t you think it a waste of time
devoting so much of it to horseracing?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“What can a fellow do? There’s coursing,
to be sure, and they’re getting up a trotting
match. I make believe to do a little work in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>the governor’s office, you know, but I’m dead
beat to get through the day as it is.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Try a year in the bush, my dear boy. You
could soon learn to manage one of your father’s
stations. It would be a healthy change from
town life.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“By Jove! It <em>would</em> be a change indeed!
Ha, ha! ‘Right you are, says Moses.’ But I
stayed at Banyule one shearing, and I give you
my word I was that sick of it all that I should
have suicided if I had not been let come to
town. The same everlasting grind—sheep,
supers, and saltbush; rides, drives, wire fences,
dams, dampers, and dingoes—day after day.
At night it was worse—not a blessed thing to
amuse yourself with. I used to play draughts
with the book-keeper.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“But you could surely read! Books are easy
to get up, and there are always neighbours.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I couldn’t stand reading out there, anyhow;
the books we had were all dry stuff, and the
neighbours were such a deuced slow lot. Things
are not too lively in Sydney, but it’s heaven
compared with the bush. I want the governor
to let me go to Europe. I should fancy Paris
for a year or so. Take another glass of this
Madeira; it’s not an everyday wine. No!
Then I will, as I see the governor’s toddlin’.”</p>

<p class='c001'>In the drawing-room matters were in a
general way more satisfactory. A lady with a
voice apparently borrowed from the angelic
choir was singing when they entered, and Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Stamford, passionately fond of music, moved
near the grand piano to listen. The guests
disposed themselves <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>au plaisir</em></span>.</p>

<p class='c001'>Master Carlo, singling out Mrs. Loreleigh,
devoted himself to her for the rest of the evening,
with perfect indifference to the claims of
the other lady guests.</p>

<p class='c001'>“What a lovely voice Mrs. Thrushton has!”
said his hostess to Stamford, as soon as the
notes of enchantment came to an end.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Lovely indeed!” echoed he; “it is long
since I have heard such a song, if ever—though
my daughter Laura has a voice worth listening
to. But will not Miss Grandison sing?” he said
after a decent interval.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Josie has been well taught, and few girls
sing better when she likes,” said her mother
with a half sigh; “but she is so capricious that
I can’t always get her to perform for us. She
has got into an argument with Count Zamoreski,
that handsome young Pole you see across the
room, and she says she’s not coming away to
amuse a lot of stupid people. Josie is quite a
character, I assure you, and really the girls are
so dreadfully self-willed nowadays, that there is
no doing anything with them. But you must
miss society so much in the bush! Don’t you?
There are very few nice men to be found there,
I have heard.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“We are not so badly off as you suppose,
Mrs. Grandison. People even there keep themselves
informed of the world’s doings, and value
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>art and literature. I often think the young
people devote more time to mental culture than
they do in town.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Indeed! I should hardly have supposed so.
They can get masters so easily in town, and
then again the young folks have such chances of
meeting the best strangers—people of rank, for
instance, and so on—that they never can dream
of even <em>seeing</em>, away from town. Mr. Grandison
wanted me to go into the bush when the
children were young; and indeed one of his
stations, Banyule, was a charming place, but I
never would hear of it.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“A town life fulfilled all your expectations,
I conclude.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Yes, really, I think so; very nearly, that is
to say. Josie has such ease of manner and is so
thoroughly at home with people in every rank
of life that I feel certain she will make her
mark some day.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“And your son Carlo?”</p>

<p class='c001'>“Well, I don’t mind telling you, as an old
friend, Mr. Stamford, that Mr. Grandison is
uneasy about him sometimes, says he won’t
settle down to anything, and is—well not really
dissipated, you know, but inclined to be fast.
But I tell him that will wear off as he gets
older. Boys will be boys. Besides, see what
an advantage it is to him to be in the society of
men like Captain Maelstrom, Sir Harry
Falconer, and people of that stamp.”</p>

<p class='c001'>“I am not so sure of that, but I trust all will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>come right, my dear Mrs. Grandison. It is a
great responsibility that we parents undertake.
There is nothing in life but care and trouble, it
seems to me, in one form or another. And
now, as I hear the carriages coming up, I will
say good night.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford went home to his hotel, much
musing on the events of the evening, nor was
he able to sleep, indeed, during the early portion
of the night, in consequence of the uneasiness
which the unsatisfactory condition of
his friend’s family caused him.</p>

<p class='c001'>“Poor Grandison!” he said to himself.
“More than once have I envied him his easy
circumstances. I suppose it is impossible for a
man laden with debt and crushed with poverty
to avoid that sort of thing. But I shall never
do so again. With all my troubles, if I
thought Hubert and Laura were likely to become
like those two young people as a natural
consequence, I would not change places with
him to-morrow. The boy, so early <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>blasé</em></span>, with
evil knowledge of the world, tainted with the
incurable vice of gambling, too fond of wine
already, what has he to look forward to?
What will he be in middle age? And the girl,
selfish and frivolous, a woman of the world,
when hardly out of her teens, scorning her
mother’s wishes, owning no law but her own
pleasure, looking forward but to a marriage of
wealth or rank, if her own undisciplined feelings
stand not in the way! Money is good, at any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>rate, as far as it softens the hard places of life;
but if I thought that wealth would bring such
a blight upon my household, would so wither
the tender blossoms of hope and faith, would
undermine manly endeavour and girlish graces,
I would spurn it from me to-morrow. I would—--”</p>

<p class='c001'>With which noble and sincere resolve Mr.
Stamford fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c001'>Upon awaking next morning, he was almost
disposed to think that the strength of his disapproval
as to the younger members of the
Grandison family might only have been enthusiasm,
artificially heightened by his host’s
extremely good wine. “That were indeed a
breach of hospitality,” he said to himself.
“And after all, it is not, strictly speaking, my
affair. I am grown rusty and precise, it may
be, from living so monotonous a life in the
bush, so far removed from the higher fashionable
existence. Doubtless these things, which
appear to me so dangerous and alarming, are
only the everyday phenomena of a more artificial
society. Let us hope for the best—that
Carlo Grandison may tone down after a few
years, and that Miss Josie’s frivolity may subside
into mere fashionable matronhood.”</p>

<p class='c001'>Mr. Stamford finished his breakfast with an
appetite which proved either his moderation in
the use of the good familiar creature over-night,
or a singularly happy state of the biliary secretions.
He then proceeded in a leisurely way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>to open his letters. Glancing at the postmark
“Mooramah,” the little country town near
home, and recognising Hubert’s bold, firm
handwriting, he opened it, and read as follows:—</p>

<p class='c008'>“<span class='sc'>My dear old Dad</span>,—I have no doubt
you are enjoying yourself quietly, but thoroughly,
now that you have cleared off the
Bank of New Guinea and got in with the
Austral Agency Company. Mother says you
are to give yourself all reasonable treats, and
renew your youth if possible, but not to think
you have the Bank of England to draw upon
just yet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I told her you were to be trusted, and I
have a piece of good news for you, which will
bear a little extravagance on its back. I am
very glad we were able to pay off that bank.</p>

<p class='c009'>“They had no right to push you as they did.
However, I suppose they can’t always help it.
Now for the news, if some beastly telegram has
not anticipated it. We have had RAIN!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, rain in large letters! What do you
think of that? Forty-eight hours of steady
rain! Five inches sixty points! Didn’t it
come down!—cats and dogs, floods and waterspouts!</p>

<p class='c009'>“The drought has broken up. The river
is tearing down a banker. You can see the
grass grow already. All bother about feed
and water put safely away for a year at least.
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>“I have sent most of the sheep out back.
Dams all full, but none carried away, thank
goodness!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I got the hill paddock fence finished and
the weaners all into it yesterday. Didn’t get
home till midnight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The run like a batter pudding, soaked right
down to the bed rock. We shall have more
grass than we can use. Old Saville (Save-all, I
call him!) would sell five thousand young sheep,
mixed sexes. He wants to realise. If Mr.
Barrington Hope, or whatever his name is,
will stand it, they would pay to buy. Wire
me if I can close, but of course I don’t expect
it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think I may safely treat myself to John
Richard Green’s <cite>Making of England</cite> and Motley’s
<cite>Rise of the Dutch Republic</cite>, so please post
them. Everything looking first-rate. Laura
is writing too.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your loving son,</p>
<p class='c011'><span class='sc'>Hubert Stamford</span>.”</p>

<p class='c012'>Next came a letter in a neat, characteristic,
legible hand, not angular-feminine, which he
well knew:—</p>

<p class='c013'>“<span class='sc'>Oh! darling Dad</span>,—We are all gone
straight out of our senses with joy. We have
had such blessed and beauteous rain. The
windows of Heaven have indeed been opened—where
else could such a lovely downpour come
from?</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“All our doubts and fears are cleared away.
Hubert has been working himself to death, poor
boy; off before daylight and never home till
twelve or one in the morning. He says that
we shall have the best season known for years,
and that nothing can possibly hurt the grass for
a whole twelvemonth. Besides, more rain is
sure to come. They always say that though.
Some water came through here and there, but it
was a blessing that Hubert and the old splitter
put the new roof over the kitchen before the
drought broke up. The dear garden looks
lovely, I have been sowing a few flower seeds—so
fresh and beautiful it is already.</p>

<p class='c011'>“I rode to one of the out-stations with
Hubert yesterday, and we got such glorious
ferns coming back. I am sorry to say dear
mother is not over strong. The hot weather,
and the old trouble, ‘no servants,’ have been too
much for her. Do you think you could bring
back a good, willing girl as cook and laundress—that
would shift the hardest part of the work off
our shoulders—and I think Linda and I could
manage the house-work, and be thankful too?
Try your best, that’s a good old dad!</p>

<p class='c011'>“I have been reading <cite>Middlemarch</cite> strictly in
spare time, and am getting on pretty well with
my German and Italian. If you could bring
up two or three books, and by all means a pretty
song or two, we should have nothing left to
wish for. Now that the rain has come, it seems
like a new world. I intend to do great things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>in languages next year. How about Mrs.
Carlyle’s letters? From the review we saw
in <cite>The Australasian</cite>, they must be deeply interesting.
We expect you to return quite restored
to your old self. Write longer letters,
and I am always,</p>

<div class='c014'>“Your loving daughter,</div>
<div class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Laura Stamford</span>.”</div>

<p class='c012'>“So far, so good, indeed,” quoth Mr. Stamford
to himself. “The year has turned with
a vengeance. Let me see what the <cite>Herald’s</cite>
telegrams say. Lucky I did not look at the
paper. So Hubert’s letter gives me first news.
Ah! another letter. Handwriting unknown,
formal, with the English postmark, too. No
bad news, I hope. Though I can hardly imagine
any news of importance from the old
country, good or bad, now. Luckily, I am
outside the pale of bad news for a while, thanks
to Barrington Hope and this breaking up of the
drought. What says the <cite>Herald</cite>?</p>

    <div class='c000'>“(From our Own Correspondent.)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“Drought broken up. Heavy, continuous
rain. Six inches in forty-eight hours. Country
under water. Dams full. A grand season anticipated.</p>

<p class='c012'>“Quite right for once, ‘Our Own Correspondent,’
albeit too prone to pronounce the
‘drought broken up’ on insufficient data. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>now accurately and carefully observant. I drink
to him in a fresh cup of tea.</p>

<p class='c017'>“And now for the unknown correspondent.
Here we have him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford carefully and slowly opened his
letter, after examining all outward superscription
and signs. Thus went the unaccustomed
missive:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-l c018'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>”<span class='sc'>Harold Stamford, Esq.</span>,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>“Windāhgil Station, Mooramah,</div>
      <div class='line in4'>“New South Wales, Australia.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='c019'>”<span class='sc'>London</span>, 23 Capel Court,</div>
<div class='c020'>“<em>April 14, 1883</em>.</div>

<p class='c017'>“<span class='sc'>Sir</span>,—It has become our duty to announce
the fact that, consequent upon the death of your
cousin, Godwin Stamford, Esq., late of Stamford
Park, Berkshire, you are entitled to the sum of
one hundred and seventy-three thousand four
hundred and sixty-nine pounds fourteen shillings
and ninepence (£173,469 14<em>s.</em> 9<em>d.</em>), with interest
from date, which sum now stands to your credit
in the Funds.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are possibly aware that your cousin’s
only son, Mark Atheling Stamford, would have
inherited the said sum, and other moneys and
property, at the death of his father, had he not
been unfortunately lost in his yacht, the <em>Walrus</em>,
in a white squall in the Mediterranean, a few
days before the date of this letter.</p>

<p class='c017'>“In his will, the late Mr. Godwin Stamford
named you, as next of kin, to be the legatee of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>this amount, in the case of the deceased Mark
Atheling Stamford dying without issue. We
have communicated with our agent, Mr. Worthington,
of Phillip Street, Sydney, from whom
you will be enabled to learn all necessary particulars.
We shall feel honoured by your
commands as to the disposal or investment of
this said sum, or any part of it. All business
with which you may think fit to entrust our
firm shall have prompt attention.—We have the
honour to be, Sir, your obedient servants,</p>

<div class='c019'>“<span class='sc'>Wallingford, Richards &amp; Stowe</span>.”</div>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Stamford read the letter carefully from
end to end, twice, indeed, with an unmoved
countenance. He pushed it away; he walked
up and down the room. Then he went into the
balcony of the hotel and gazed at the people in
the street. He retired to his bed-room after
this, whence he did not emerge for a short
space.</p>

<p class='c017'>Returning to the table he sat calmly down,
gazing at his letter, and again examining the
signature, the important figures, which also had
the value set forth formally in writing. Yes,
there was no mistake. It was not seven
thousand four hundred and sixty-nine pounds.
Nothing of the kind. One hundred and seventy
thousand pounds and the rest. “One hundred
and seventy thousand!” He repeated the
words over and over again in a calm and collected
voice. Then the tears rushed to his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>eyes, and he laid his head on his hands and
sobbed like a child.</p>

<p class='c017'>“For what did it all mean? Nothing less
than this. That he was a rich man for life.
That his wife, best-beloved, tender, patient, self-sacrificing
as she had always been since he took
her, a fresh-hearted, beautiful girl, from her
father’s house, where she had never known
aught but the most loving care, the most elaborate
comfort, would henceforth be enabled to
enjoy all the old pleasures, even the luxuries of
life, from which they had all been so long
debarred. They could live in Sydney or Melbourne,
as it pleased them best. They could
even sojourn in London or Paris, and travel on
the continent of Europe.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The girls could have all the ‘advantages,’
as they are called, of the best teaching, the best
society, change of scene, travel.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Great Heaven! what a vista of endless
bliss seemed opening before him!”</p>

<p class='c017'>But then, as he sat and thought, another
aspect of the case, dimly, shadowy, of darker
colours and stranger light, seemed to pass before
him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Would the effect of the sudden withdrawal
of all necessity for effort, all reason for self-denial,
be favourable to the development of
these tenderly-cultured, generous but still youthful
natures?</p>

<p class='c017'>“When the cares of this world—which up to
this point had served but to elevate and ennoble—were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>dismissed, would ‘the deceitfulness
of riches’ have power to choke the good
seed?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Would the tares multiply and flourish,
overrunning the corn, and would the uprooting
of them import another trouble—a difficulty
which might be enlarged into a sorrow?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Would indolence and reckless enjoyment
succeed to the resolute march along the pathway
of duty, to the prayerful trust in that Almighty
Father who granted strength from day to day?
Would the taste for simple pleasures, which now
proved so satisfying, be lost irrevocably, to be
succeeded, perhaps, by a dangerous craving for
excitement, by satiety or indifferentism?</p>

<p class='c017'>“What guarantee was there for this conservation
of the healthful tone of body and mind
when the mainsprings of all action, restraint,
and self-discipline were in one hour relaxed or
broken?</p>

<p class='c017'>“Could he bear to behold the gradual degeneration
which might take place, which had
so manifested itself, as he had witnessed, in
natures perhaps not originally inferior to their
own?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Long and anxiously did Harold Stamford
ponder over these thoughts, with nearly as grave
a face, as anxious a brow, as he had worn in his
deepest troubles.</p>

<p class='c017'>At length he arose with a resolved air. He
left the hotel, and took his way to the office of
Mr. Worthington, whom he knew well, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>had been his legal adviser and the depository of
all official confidences for many years past.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was he who had drawn the deed by which
the slender dowry of his wife, with some
moderate addition of his own, had been settled
upon her. He knew that he could be trusted
implicitly with his present intentions; that the
secret he intended to confide in him this day
would be inviolably preserved.</p>

<p class='c017'>This, then, was the resolution at which Harold
Stamford had arrived. He would <em>not</em> abruptly
alter the conditions of his family life; he would
gradually and unostentatiously ameliorate the
circumstances of the household. But he would
defer to a future period the information that
riches had succeeded to this dreaded and probable
poverty. He would endeavour to maintain
the standard of “plain living and high thinking,”
in which his family had been reared; he
would preserve it in its integrity, as far as lay in
his power until, with characters fully formed,
tried, and matured, his children would in all probability
be enabled to withstand the allurements
of luxury, the flatteries of a facile society, the
insidious temptations of the world, the flesh, and
the devil.</p>

<p class='c017'>Intent upon removing such dangers from
their path in life, he felt himself warranted in
using the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>suppressio veri</em></span> which he meditated.
And he implored the blessing of God upon his
endeavours to that end.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then, again, the station? It must stand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>apparently upon its own foundation. What pride
and joy to Hubert’s ardent nature for the next
few years would it be to plot and plan, to labour
and to endure, in order to compass the freedom of
the beloved home from debt! Now that the
rain <em>had</em> come, that the account was in good
standing, he had felt so sanguine of success that
it would be cruel to deprive him of the gratification
he looked forward to—the privilege he so
prized.</p>

<p class='c017'>And what task would employ every faculty of
mind and body more worthily, more nobly, than
this one to which he had addressed himself!
Hubert’s favourite quotation occurred to him—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>And how can man die better</div>
      <div class='line in2'>Than facing fearful odds,</div>
      <div class='line'>For the ashes of his fathers,</div>
      <div class='line in2'>And the temples of his gods?</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>This he was wont to declaim when his mother,
meeting him as he returned from weary rides,
chilled by winter frosts, burnt black well-nigh
by summer suns, had many a time and oft
expostulated, telling him that he would kill
himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>The tears came into the father’s eyes as he
thought of these things.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor Hubert! poor boy! How he has
worked; how he means to work in the future!
We must manage not to let him overdo things
now. I daresay I shall be able to slacken
the pace a little for him without his suspecting
the real cause.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>As he thought of his son, sitting Centaur-like
on his favourite horse, with his head up, his
throat bare, courage in his eye and manly resolution
in his whole bearing—wild to do anything
that was self-sacrificing, dangerous, laborious,
fully repaid by a smile from his mother, a kiss
from Laura, a nod of approval from himself—he
could not help contrasting him with Carlo
Grandison, the product, as he surmised, of a life
of ease—of a system where self-restraint had
been rendered obsolete.</p>

<p class='c017'>He thought of Laura’s patient labours, of her
constancy to uncongenial tasks, of her fresh,
unsullied bloom, and sweet, childlike nature.</p>

<p class='c017'>“God forbid!” he said, “that they should ever
know wealth if such a transformation is likely to
take place in their character. I know what they
are now. It shall be my aim to preserve them
in their present innocence. Let them remain
unspotted from the world. I must invent a
way by which fair development and mental
culture may be furnished. But as to taking
them away from this humble retreat where all
their natural good qualities have so grown and
flourished in the healthful atmosphere of home
life, it were a sin to do it. I have made up my
mind.” And here Mr. Stamford almost frowned
as he walked along and looked as stern as it was
in his nature to do.</p>

<p class='c017'>On arriving at Mr. Worthington’s chambers,
with the precious document carefully secured
within his pocket book, he found that gentleman
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>engaged. He, however, sent in his card with a
request to be admitted at his leisure upon
business of importance, and received a reply
to the effect that if he could remain for a
quarter of an hour, the principal would be at
liberty.</p>

<p class='c017'>The time seemed not so long with a tranquil
mind. The days of the torture-chamber were
over.</p>

<p class='c017'>He employed it in re-considering the points
of his argument, and when the door of Mr.
Worthington’s private room opened, he felt his
position strengthened.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Sorry to detain you,” said the lawyer, “but
it is a rule of mine to take clients as they come,
great and small. Haven’t seen you for some
time, Mr. Stamford. Had rain, I hear, in your
country; that means everything—everything
good. What can I do for you?”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The eminent solicitor, than whom no man in
his profession held more family confidences, not
to say secrets in trust, here fixed a pair of keen
grey eyes, not unkindly in expression, but
marvellously direct and searching, upon his
visitor.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have had a communication with reference
to the subject of this letter,” said Mr.
Stamford, placing it before him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ah! Wallingford, Richards and Stowe—first-class
men in the profession. Now you
mention it, I certainly have, and I congratulate
you heartily upon it. I have heard generally
about your affairs, Mr. Stamford; losses and
crosses, bad seasons, and so on. It has come at
the right time, hasn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It certainly has; but, curiously, I had
managed, with the aid of the grand change of
season, to do without it. Now I have at once an
explanation and an uncommon request to make.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Worthington settled himself in his chair
and took a pinch of snuff. “My dear sir,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>said he, “pray go on. I am in the habit of
hearing uncommon requests and curious explanations
every day of my life.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Perhaps I may surprise even you a little.
In the first place, does any one know of this
rather exceptional legacy which I have received,
or rather to which I am entitled?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Worthington unlocked an escritoire,
opened a drawer labelled “Private,” and took
from it a letter in the same handwriting as the
one before them. “Here is Wallingford’s letter.
It has been seen by no eye but mine. It was
answered by me personally. No other living
soul is aware of it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have reasons, connected with my family
chiefly, for not desiring to permit my accession
to a fortune, for such it is, to be known by
them, or by the public generally, till, at any rate,
a certain number of years has passed. Can this
be done?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Most assuredly, I can receive the money,
which will then be at your disposal. No one
need be a jot the wiser.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s exactly what I want you to do for
me. To invest the amount securely, and to let
the interest accumulate for the present. At the
same time, I may, upon notice, be compelled to
draw upon it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That can be easily done. The interest will
be lodged in the Occidental Bank—they have no
directors there, by the way—to be drawn out if
required, by cheque signed by you and me or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>my partner at my decease—must provide for
everything, you know. If you require the whole,
or any part, you have but to let me know, and
I can send you the firm’s written guarantee that
the money will be at your credit at the bank
referred to, on any given day.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am not likely to require the principal, but
the interest I may draw upon from time to time.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The arrangement can be made precisely as
you desire. When you authorise us on that
behalf, the principal sum can be transmitted to
this colony without delay. You will be able to
secure seven or eight per cent. interest upon
mortgage here without risk; and, as I said
before, to draw, should you require, by giving
reasonable notice. The course you are about to
adopt is unusual; but I presume your reasons to
be adequate. It is not my business to be concerned
with them further than regards their legal
aspect.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have made my course easy, my dear
sir, and relieved me of some anxiety. I wish
now to give instructions for the addition of a
codicil to my will, which is in your office. That
being done, our business will be over.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This truly momentous interview was at length
concluded most satisfactorily, as Mr. Stamford
thought. He made his way back to his hotel
in a serious but not uncheerful state of mind,
reserving till the following day a last interview
with Mr. Barrington Hope.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the morrow, when he betook himself to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the offices of the Austral Agency Company, he
smiled as he thought with what different feelings
he had made his first entrance. How
agitated had been his mind with hope and fear!
Scarcely daring to believe that he would receive
other than the stereotyped answer to so many
such requests—“Would have been happy under
any other circumstances. Stock and stations
unsalable. The money market in so critical
a condition. The company have decided to
make no further advances for the present. At
another time, probably,” and so forth. He
knew the formula by heart.</p>

<p class='c017'>How fortunate for him that it had been the
policy of this company, shaped by the alert and
enterprising financial instinct of Barrington
Hope, to entertain his proposal; to make the
sorely needed advance; to float the sinking
argosy; to risk loss and guarantee speculative
transactions for the sake of extending the business
of the company and gaining the confidence
of the great pastoral interest. The bold stroke,
carried out as to so many larger properties than
poor, hardly-pressed Windāhgil, had been successful.
The daring policy, now that the rain had
come, had turned out to be wisely prescient.
Capitalists began to talk of the man who, comparatively
young, had shown such nerve and
decision in the throes of a financial crisis—such
as had just passed, thank God! The oft-quoted
succour might have proceeded chiefly from a
superior quality of head.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>But Mr. Stamford told himself that to his
dying day he should always credit Barrington
Hope with those attributes of the heart which
were rarely granted to meaner men.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the present interview there were of course
mutual congratulations.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Had rain, I saw by the telegram, my dear
sir. Heartily glad for your sake—indeed, for
our own. Squatters fully appreciate the benefit
their class receives by such a glorious change in
the seasons. I wonder if they always remember
their hard-worked brethren, the managers of
banks and finance companies, upon whose weary
brains such a weight of responsibility presses.
Well, ‘to each his sufferings, all are men condemned
alike to groan,’ &amp;c.; we must bear our
burdens as we best may. But this is very
frivolous. It must be the rain. Nearly six
inches! Enough to make any one talk nonsense.
What can I do for you at present?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford shortly gave a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>résumé</em></span> of
Hubert’s letter, and mentioned the store sheep.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Certainly, by all means; if, as I assume,
you will have grass to spare. Buy for cash and
save the discount. Would you like to telegraph?
Excuse me.” He summoned a clerk.
“Mr. Stamford wishes this telegram sent at
once.” He had written: “Buy store sheep at
once—for cash. Draw at sight.—<span class='sc'>Barrington
Hope.</span>—<span class='sc'>Hubert Stamford</span>, Esq., Mooramah.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is that right? Mr. Bowker, you will see
that message sent through.” The door closed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>“It is best not to lose time in these matters.
Don’t you think so? Prices are rising every
hour; sheep might be withdrawn.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford was quite of the same opinion,
and was moreover delighted with the promptness
with which the transaction was concluded.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Shall you want more sheep before shearing?
If so, don’t scruple to buy.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, we shall have more grass than we
know what to do with, Hubert says,” commenced
Mr. Stamford, rather aghast at this
magnificent manner of buying all before him;
“but I don’t know whether there is not a risk
of over-stocking.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“None whatever, I should say; take
advantage of a good season when it comes,
that’s the modern stock policy. Some very
successful men, whose names I could tell you,
always practise it. You will consult your son
when you go home and let me know. But,
admitting that you bought up to your carrying
capacity, and sold all but your best sheep directly
after shearing, you might make all safe, as they
say at sea. Our Queensland constituents are
buying largely to stock up new country. As
your district has a good name for wool, you
would have no difficulty in quitting them at a
profit.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That makes a difference, certainly,” said
Mr. Stamford, to whose mind—long a <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>tabula
rasa</em></span> as regards speculation, having been too
deeply occupied in compassing mere existence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>(pecuniarily speaking)—gorgeous enterprises
and profits commenced to present themselves.
“I will talk it over with Hubert, and let you
know.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Certainly; wire rather than write, though;
in matters of importance time is generally most
precious. You are going; good bye! Most
happy that our business intercourse has
progressed so favourably.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You must permit me, my dear Mr. Hope,
to say that I feel most grateful,” said Mr.
Stamford, standing up and holding out his hand,
“deeply grateful personally, for your kindness
and courtesy, outside of any business relation
whatever. No, you must not stop me. I shall
feel it to my dying day, and I trust you will
come and see us at our home—the home you
saved for us, I shall always think—whenever
you visit our part of the country.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The hand-clasp was sincere and hearty; the
interview terminated. The squatter went his
way musingly down narrow, not over-straight
George Street, on either side of which towering
freestone buildings seemed to be uprising daily;
while Barrington Hope addressed himself to a
pile of letters from which he hardly raised his
head until the closing of the office. As for
Mr. Stamford, his day’s work was done. He
mechanically thought over the store sheep
question, but his face suddenly changed as he
remembered in such matters he would be
absolved from all anxiety or doubt in future.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>What rest—rest—all blessed rest of mind and
body, would be his for all time to come!</p>

<p class='c017'>Are there any disorders, sorrows, misfortunes,
here below which so surely, if gradually, eat
away the heart of man as those which spring
from pecuniary dearth or doubt?</p>

<p class='c017'>How the days are dimmed! How the nights
are troubled! The glory of the sky, the
beauty of the flower, the breath of morn, the
solemn hush of midnight, Nature’s best gifts
and treasures, how unheeded all, if not despised
are they, when exhibited before the wretched
thrall of debt!</p>

<p class='c017'>To the galley slave in old classic days what
were the purple waters of the Egean—the
haunting beauty of the temple-crowned promontory?
The choral dances, the flower-wreathed
fanes of the Greek Isles were but
mockeries to the haggard rowers of the trireme
as she swept by, all too close to land. The
grim jest of the old-world humorist was keenly
close—that even the demons of the nethermost
pit disdained to torture the luckless debtor, so
wasted and dried up was every attribute of body
and soul!</p>

<p class='c017'>And was he indeed the same Harold Stamford
that paced this very street wearily and so
despondingly but one poor week agone? “And
without the timely aid of the Austral Agency
Company,” thought he, “I was even then so
near to safety, to triumph! I feel like the
man who clung so long to a marsh pile the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>long night through, in dread of drowning, and,
dropping from exhaustion, found himself in
four feet of water. And how wretched and
despairing was I, how little hope was there in
the world apparently! But for Linda and the
children, I could have found it in my heart to
make a quick end, in the harbour, of the misery
which was becoming unendurable. It shows
that a man should never despair. There are
always chances. Hundreds, as poor Hubert
said. But shall I ever forget Barrington Hope
and his kindness? No, or may God forget me
in my need. And what a grand fellow he
seems to be!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Having satisfactorily finished his soliloquy,
Mr. Stamford bethought himself that he would
make a parting call upon his friends, the
Grandisons. He was going home in a day or
two now and should be tolerably busy, he knew
by experience, what with commissions and other
matters which he was but too apt to put off till
the last moment.</p>

<p class='c017'>The ladies were engaged. Mr. Grandison
was, however, at home, and, as it turned out,
not in that cheerful frame of mind which
befitted so rich a man. He had the world’s
goods in profusion, but as Stamford marked his
anxious brow and perturbed countenance, he
saw that something had gone wrong.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, it’s you, is it?” Mr. Grandison said.
“I was afraid it was a young fellow just out
from home—got letters to us—the Honourable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>Mr. Devereux; he’s not a bad chap, but I
don’t feel up to talking to a youngster I never
saw before and won’t see again after next week.
Come into my den and have a yarn, Harold.
I want to talk to you. And, I say, stop and
have a quiet <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tête-à-tête</em></span> dinner. They’re going
out—Josie and her mother—to one of Ketten’s
recitals, as they call it. I’m in no humour for
musical humbug, I can tell you. I’m worried
to death about that eldest boy of mine, Carlo.
Stay, like a good fellow, and you can advise
me. I’m fairly puzzled.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This was a matter of charity, and old friendship
besides. Stamford’s heart was touched at
the spectacle of his old comrade troubled and in
distress. He forgot the obtrusive magnificence,
and thought of the long past days when they
rode together beneath burning sky or winter
storm, before one had found the road to
fortune and the other had taken the bye-path
which had only ended in happiness. “All
right, Bob,” he answered. “You shall have all
the help I can offer. I’m sorry you’ve cause to
be uneasy about the boy. We must hope for
the best though. Youthful imprudence is not
so uncommon.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s worse than that,” said Mr. Grandison,
gloomily—with a portentous shake of his head.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Just as dinner was announced, the carriage
behind the grand three hundred guinea browns—perhaps
the best pair in Sydney—rolled up to the
door. Mrs. Grandison and Miss Josie fluttered
down the stairs a few minutes afterwards in the
full glory of evening costume. As host and
guest stood in the hall, the lady of the house
vouchsafed a slight explanation, mingled with
faint regret that the latter was not coming with
them.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You know, Mr. Stamford, this is one of
that dear Ketten’s last recitals. We really
could not afford to miss it—especially as our
friends, the Cranberrys, will be there. Lady C.
sent a private message to Josie that she <em>must</em>
go. I wanted to stop, for we really are
miserable about that wicked boy Carlo; but
Josie said it couldn’t make any difference to
him, and why should we punish ourselves
because he chose to be selfish and extravagant.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford could not wholly assent to
these philosophical propositions. He thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>of what Laura’s pleasure in hearing the musical
magnate would have been on the same evening
that Hubert had been declared a defaulter as to
play debts, and was socially, if not legally, under
a cloud.</p>

<p class='c017'>He simply bowed coldly. Then he saw the
pained maternal expression in Mrs. Grandison’s
face, in spite of her worldliness and frivolity,
and his heart smote him.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dear Mrs. Grandison,” he said, taking
her hand, “I feel for you most deeply.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Then suddenly came a voice from the
carriage, in which Miss Josie had ensconced
herself. “Mamma, I shall catch cold if we wait
one moment longer. Hadn’t you better postpone
your interesting talk with Mr. Stamford?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Grandison started, and then recovering
herself, shook Mr. Stamford’s hand. “You
will talk it over with Robert, won’t you? You
are old friends, you know. Don’t let him be
too hard on poor Carlo. I’m sure he has a
good heart. Pray come and see us again before
you leave.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The portly form of his hostess moved off at
a swifter rate than her appearance denoted. The
footman banged the carriage door, and the grand
equipage rattled out over the mathematically
accurate curves of the drive. The dinner gong
commenced to resound after a warlike and
sudden fashion, and caused Mr. Stamford to
betake himself hurriedly to the drawing-room.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>There he found Mr. Grandison standing by the
fire-place in a meditative position.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Grandison turned at his friend’s entrance.
“Seen Mrs. Grandison? Has she told you
about it? Well, they’re gone now, and we can
talk it over quietly. Come in to dinner. I’ve
no appetite, God knows! but I want something
to steady my nerves.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The dinner, somewhat restricted for the
occasion, was extremely good, though his host
ate little, confining himself to a cutlet and some
wonderful brown sherry. Not until the dessert
was placed before them and they were alone did
he begin the subject which lay so near to his
heart.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of course I know, Stamford, that young
fellows like my boy can’t be expected to live in
a town like Sydney upon a screwy allowance—at
any rate not if they are to be seen in good
company. Therefore I’ve always said to Carlo,
‘Let me see you make your mark, and live like
a gentleman. That’s all I ask of you, and you
sha’n’t want for a hundred or two.’ I hadn’t
got it to spend when I was his age—you know
that, Harold; but if I like my youngster to be
a bit different in some things, that’s my own
affair, isn’t it, as long as I am willing to pay for
it? Well that’s all right, you say. Take some
of this claret, it won’t hurt you. It’s my own
importation from Bordeaux. Of course I didn’t
want the boy to slave in an office, nor yet to
live in the bush year after year with nothing but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>station hands to talk to. If Mrs. Grandison
had done what I wanted her to do, while the
children were young, and lived quietly at
Banyule, it might have been different. There
we could have had everything comfortable;
nearly as good as here. It would have been
better for me, and them too, I expect. But she
wouldn’t see it, and that’s why we’ve always
lived in town.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Still,” interposed Stamford, “though you
have been well enough off to afford to live
where you pleased, I can’t imagine why Carlo
should not keep the course and run straight,
even in Sydney, like other young men of his
age.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Grandison sighed and filled his glass.
“Some do, and some don’t, that’s about the
size of it. I don’t know why the lad shouldn’t
have enjoyed himself in reason like young
Norman McAllister, Jack Staunton, Neil
O’Donnell, and others that we know. They’ve
always had lots of money, too; they’ve been
home to the Old Country and knocked about
by themselves, and I never heard that they’ve
got into rows or overrun the constable. How
my boy should have made such a fool of himself
with a father that’s always stuck well to him, I
can’t think. I’m afraid we’ve thought too
much of his swell friends’ names and families,
and not enough of their principles. I’ve told
my wife that before now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But what has he done?” asked Stamford.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>“If it’s a matter of a few thousands, you can
settle that easily enough—particularly now
we’ve had rain,” continued he, introducing the
pleasantry as a slight relief to his friend’s self-reproachful
strain.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, of course, I can do that, thank God!
rain or no rain, though it made a matter of
thirty thousand profit to me on those back
Dillandra blocks—more than that. I shouldn’t
care if the money was all; but this is how it is.
I may as well bring it straight out. It seems
that Carlo and Captain Maelstrom (d—--n him!—I
never liked a bone in his body) and some
others were playing loo last week with a young
fellow whose father had just died and left him a
lot of money. The stakes ran up high—a deal
higher than the club committee would have
allowed if they’d known about it. Well, just
at first they had it all their own way. This
young chap was a long way to the bad—thousands,
they say. Then the luck turned,
and after that they never held a card. He
played a bold game, and the end of it was that
Carlo and the Captain were ten thousand out,
and of course neither of them able to pay up.
The Captain managed to get time, but Carlo,
like a fool, went straight off and said nothing
about it. He was afraid to come to me, it
seems, as we’d had a row last time; so he did
the very worst thing he could have done and
cleared out to Tasmania. We got a letter
yesterday. He’s over there now.” Here Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Grandison fairly groaned, and looked piteously
in his old friend’s face.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, well! but after all,” said Mr.
Stamford, “of course it’s bad enough, gambling—high
stakes and folly generally; but if you
pay up, things will be much as they were, and
it will be a lesson to him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope it may be, but the worst of it is,”
went on Mr. Grandison, “that the whole thing
came out, and there was a regular <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>exposé</em></span>. The
young fellow, Newlands, made a disturbance
when he wasn’t paid, swore he’d horsewhip
Carlo whenever he met him, and went on tremendously.
Then the committee of the club
took it up and talked of expelling Maelstrom
and him for playing for stakes above the proper
limit, and if the affair’s raked up it’s possible
they will. I paid up in full, of course, as soon
as I could get to know the amount. Newlands
apologised very properly and all that. But the
mischief’s done! Carlo can’t show his face in
Sydney for I don’t know how long. All our
hopes about his turning steady and settling
down are disappointed. It’s a round sum of
money to throw away for nothing, and worse
than nothing. And what to do with the boy I
don’t know.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It certainly <em>is</em> a hard case for his parents,”
said Mr. Stamford, thoughtfully. “I scarcely
know what to advise. A year or two on a
station, or a turn at exploring in the far north
used to be thought a remedy, or, at any rate, to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>hold out reasonable hope of amendment by
change of scene and fresh interests, but—--”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But that wouldn’t suit Carlo. He hates
bush life—can’t live away from excitement—and
I’m afraid, if I sent him away against his
will, he’d take to drinking, or do something
worse still. I’m at my wits’ end. He seems to
have got it into his head that I’m to provide
for him under any circumstances, and the consequence
is he never thinks of doing anything
for himself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How do you think travel would act upon
him? He has never seen the Old World, ‘the
kingdoms of the earth and the glory of them.’
Surely that would rouse sufficient enthusiasm to
counteract the meaner pleasures?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Carlo would never get further than Paris if
I trusted him alone. However, I shall have to
try it, I suppose. The long and the short of it
will be that we shall be obliged to move <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en
famille</em></span>. I can’t send him by himself after what
has happened.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I really do think it is the best thing you
can do. You can afford it easily. Station
property is likely to look up for a few years
now. You have excellent managers, and it will
most likely benefit the other young people. I
don’t see any objection; indeed everything
seems in favour of it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of course we can do it,” said his friend,
doubtfully; “but I didn’t intend to leave for a
year or two yet—until we could have entered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>Cecil at one of the universities, and, in fact,
made other arrangements. But Carlo is the
master of the situation at present—he must
be, as usual, considered before everything and
everybody. Well, I’m much obliged to you,
Stamford; indeed I feel most grateful; it has
been a great relief to my mind to be able to
talk the matter over with you quietly, and I
really believe this idea of yours of travel abroad
will suit everybody. Mrs. Grandison and Josie
will be wild with delight, I feel sure.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope you will all have reason to be satisfied
with the results of the step; and now, as it
is getting late, I will say good night.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Good night, and thank you very much, old
fellow! By the way, this rain has reached
your part of the world, I see; I suppose your
affairs are improving a bit now—look brighter,
eh!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have been enabled to make satisfactory
arrangements lately,” said Stamford, shortly.
“I have placed my account with the Austral
Agency Company and we got on very well.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Ah, indeed. Rising man, that Barrington
Hope. I wish—but it’s no use wishing. Well,
good night again! Nothing like being independent
of the banks; that’s always the safest
line!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Safest indeed,” thought his guest as he
walked down the gravel drive, just in time to
miss the blazing lamps and chariot wheels of
Mrs. Grandison’s equipage, which bore herself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>and her daughter back from the hall where the
<span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>maestro</em></span> had been delighting the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>crême de la crême</em></span>
of fashionable musical Sydney. “Safest indeed;
but how is one to manage it with
droughty seasons, and markets practically closed?
I think Master Bob might have asked that
question before. But his own troubles have
been greater than mine, poor fellow—greater,
ah, a thousandfold. What bribe, indeed, would
tempt me to change places with him?
However, we must hope for the best, though I
am afraid Carlo will only substitute Baden Baden
for Bent Street. Miserable boy!”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>The sacrifice at the altar of friendship being
duly performed, Mr. Stamford addressed himself
to the arrangements necessary for a speedy
return to the home which he had quitted under
such depressing conditions. How different were
the sensations with which he set about preparing
for departure from those which he had good
reason to fear would have overshadowed his
return journey! “The sad companion, ghastly
Care,” had retired, indefinitely banished, as far
as human foresight could discover.</p>

<p class='c017'>All difficulties, all doubt as to ways and
means, had vanished. The kind hand of
Providence had been specially exerted for his
benefit. He hardly recognised in himself the
sanguine individual that had replaced his boding,
desponding entity, tortured by vain regrets and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>undefined dread; hopeless of succour alike from
God and man!</p>

<p class='c017'>He went about his business with alacrity and
a cheerful enjoyment of life that even surprised
himself. He seemed to have renewed his
youth. Tastes and fancies which had long been
relegated to the realm of the impossible
reappeared like the wild-wood flowers of his
own land after the gracious rainfall of which he
had received tidings. He was now enabled to
indulge them in moderation with a clear
conscience.</p>

<p class='c017'>And he savoured them with a relish akin to
that of the returned traveller after perils by
land and sea, of the desert-worn pilgrim who
sees again the green fields and rippling brooks
of the fatherland which he had despaired of
again beholding.</p>

<p class='c017'>What a novel joy was it to him to awake at
midnight—at early dawn—to realise with
returning consciousness that safety, comfort,
honourable independence were to be the portion
of his loved ones henceforward and for ever!
What a relief to turn again to his pillow, and
sink into untroubled slumber with a heart filled
with gratitude—with peace unutterable!</p>

<p class='c017'>One of his first expeditions in the shopping
line was to the chief book mart, an establishment
where he previously had been wont to
linger but for short intervals, regarding with a
melancholy interest the rows of new, enticing
works, into the pages of which he hardly dared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>to look. Now he boldly produced a list of
standard authors, magazines, works of travel,
science, autobiography, fiction, what not; commanded
that they should be packed in a suitable
case and forwarded to the railway station to his
address. How he relished the actual writing of
a cheque for the amount! How the thought
of being able to enjoy them with an untroubled
mind, in the peaceful evenings at Windāhgil,
caused his spirits to rise, his heart to expand!</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert’s modest commission was not forgotten,
nor the less-developed literary needs of
Maurice and Ned, while at a neighbouring
establishment he chose a collection of music,
vocal and instrumental, which would keep Laura
and Linda moderately well employed for a
twelvemonth. A new piano the girls must have,
but not yet, not all at once, whispered Prudence.
He must not show his hand too suddenly. All
in good time. And, as a young professional of the
period ran his fingers lightly over the notes of a
lovely Erard semi-grand, Mr. Stamford almost
waltzed out of the shop, to the seductive strains
of “Auf Wiedersehn.” His last and crowning
exploit was to procure, after, perhaps, rather
more personal exertion and loss of dignity than
were expended on the foregoing transactions, the
services of a well-recommended, capable female
domestic, whose scruples at going so far into the
bush he combated by a liberal rate of wages, and
a promise to pay her return fare if she remained
for twelve months in his service. After all this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Mr. Stamford paid a farewell visit to Mr. Barrington
Hope, with whom he arranged for
shearing supplies, and, finally, at the close of an
exciting day, he found himself in the mail-train
in a state of high contentment, in charity with
all men, and honestly grateful to that Almighty
Ruler who had uplifted him from those dark
depths, at the remembrance of which he still
shuddered.</p>

<p class='c017'>At a reasonably early hour on the following
day the unpretending architecture of Mooramah
emerged from the forest hills which encompass
that rising township, and there was Hubert sure
enough, with the well-worn buggy and the good
old horses, still high in bone, though, like himself,
much improved in spirits and demeanour.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why, governor!” quoth that young man,
after an affectionate greeting and the gradual
absorption into the recesses of the buggy of the
tolerably heavy miscellaneous luggage of his
parent, “you’re quite another man. Let me
look at you. Fashionable and distinguished-looking,
I declare! Thought you were a gentleman
from England. Mother and the girls won’t
know you. I suppose it’s the rain, and Mr.
Barrington—what’s his name, Hope or Faith,
isn’t it? He seems to have lots of the latter
requisite, doesn’t he? We ought to have made
his acquaintance years ago. And this is the new
servant, I suppose. Very glad to see you, Mary
Jane. Not Mary Jane? Isabella; well, that
sounds nicer—country looks grand, doesn’t it?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Old Mooramah’s quite another place. But I
can’t take my eyes off you, governor! You
look ten years younger.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel so, my boy, I assure you. Things
have gone well, I needn’t tell you. I found
Mr. Hope a most satisfactory person to do business
with. And of course the rain has crowned
everything.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Satisfactory! I should think he was! Smartest
man we’ve ever worked with. I closed with
old Saville, and bought six thousand Riverina
ewes bred at Broongal. Sent a wire to him, had
his answer, and nailed them before dark. I believe
I could make a half-a-crown profit a head on the
whole lot. That’s something like business, if
you like.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And you’re sure you’ll have grass enough
for them and our own, too! It doesn’t do to
run risks, you know, Hubert!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Grass!” retorted the young man scornfully.
“Wait till you see the old place. Now that the
stock are all off the frontage, the prairie grass
and trefoil are coming up like a hayfield. Why,
we sha’n’t be able to <em>see</em> the sheep in it at shearing
time. Don’t the old horses go differently?
They’re picking up hand over hand, though of
course they’ve not had time to lay on flesh yet.
The sheep are quicker about it, and they look
wonderful. You’d hardly know the dry flocks.
We’re not far from the river, now; it’s just
crossable again. Wait till you come to the outer
gate. But it’s all alike. I feel almost too happy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>If I hadn’t had a good lot of hardish work just
at first, I think I should have gone off my
head.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Harold Stamford put his hand on the boy’s
shoulder, and looked with loving pride into his
clear eyes and bold, frank brow. “God in His
mercy be thanked for our prosperity, my son!”
he said. “May He keep us in health of body
and mind, and long preserve us to each other.
I feel, also, as if my cup was almost too full.
May He aid us to enjoy and use wisely the
benefits He has conferred on us!”</p>

<p class='c017'>The young man turned and wrung his father’s
hand silently.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Great Heaven!” thought Mr. Stamford to
himself, as he noted the clear bronzed cheek,
the manly, frank impression, the muscular frame
of his first-born, the whole figure instinct with
the splendid health and graceful vigour of early
manhood when developed to maturity amid the
wholesome influences of a country life. “What
a contrast does he present to Carlo Grandison!
Surely I am wise in shielding him from the disturbing
forces, the crowding temptations, with
which wealth besets mankind. I dislike every
aspect of deception, but surely the postponing
the dangerous knowledge, which would relieve
these children from all necessity for self-denial, is
a justifiable exercise of my discretion as the
head of the household. It will, it must, I feel
convinced, be for their ultimate advantage.”</p>

<p class='c017'>By the time the train of reflection induced by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>this consideration had come to an end, the river
was forded—tolerably high indeed; so much so
as to cause the new domestic some natural misgivings,
but the strong, temperate horses
breasted the swirling current, and landed them
safely, under Hubert’s experienced guidance,
upon the pebbly beach of the farther shore.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So far, so good,” said the charioteer; “we
couldn’t have done that yesterday, and it’s not
every pair of horses that would fancy all that
rushing and bubbling of the stream. Don’t
you remember Mr. Round nearly making a
mess of it last year at night in this very place,
with the governess and all the children too?
He had a pretty bad quarter of an hour after
he broke his pole. Now look at the grass,
that’s something like, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford had seen such things before in
his pastoral experience. Not for the first time
did he look upon the marvellous transformation
wrought in “dry country” by forty-eight hours’
rain. But he could not avoid an exclamation of
surprise when he gazed around him. Was this
the same place—the same country even, which
he had driven over so lately to catch the train,
with the self-same pair of horses too?</p>

<p class='c017'>Then the river trickled in a thin rivulet from
one pond to another in the wide, half-dry bed
of the stream; then the dusty banks were lined
with dead sheep; the black-soiled alluvial flat
was innocent of grass in root or stalk or living
herbage as the trampled dust of a stockyard.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Now a thick, green carpet of various verdure
covered all the great meadow as far as eye could
see, and brought its bright green border to the
very verge of the sand and shingle of the river
shore.</p>

<p class='c017'>The half-flood which had resulted from the
rainfall nearer the source had swept away the
carcases of the sheep and cattle and deposited
all saddening souvenirs of the drought amid
the reed beds of the lower Mooramah. All
was spring-like and splendidly luxuriant, though
as yet but in the later autumn season. It was a
new land, a new climate, a region recovered
from the waste.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>In ten minutes Mr. Stamford was deposited
safely at the home which he had quitted with
such gloomy forebodings, such dreadful doubt
and uncertainty. Then he had asked himself,
‘Should he be enabled to call it his own on returning?
Was not Ruin’s knell already sounding
in his ears?’</p>

<p class='c017'>A few short weeks had elapsed, and how
different was the outlook! When he beheld
again the true and tender wife, the loving
daughters, the joyful children, his heart swelled
nigh to bursting. An unspoken prayer went
up to heaven that he might ever remain worthy
of the unselfish love, the trusting faith which
had been his since first he had acquired a
household of his own. How unworthy are the
best of men of such treasures—the purest, the
richest, which are granted to mortal man!</p>

<p class='c017'>When his affairs were at the worst, had he
not always known where to receive wise counsel,
tender consolation, heartfelt sympathy? When
a ray of sunshine broke through the cloud-wrack
which environed his fortunes, had not a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>double brilliancy been added to it by those
loving hearts which took their colour so readily
from his every mood? Now all was joy, peace,
magical transformation. The storm-clouds had
passed over, the menacing powers had vanished
like evil dreams. All was hope and sanguine
trust in the future. He was a monarch restored
to his throne, a leader once more in front
of his faithful band, the head of a household
which care and pain, in certain forms, could
never more approach.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So, father, you have deigned to return to
us!” said Mrs. Stamford, smiling the bright,
loving welcome which had never failed her
husband. “We began to think that the ‘pleasures
and palaces’ were becoming too much for
the ‘home, sweet home’ side of the question.
Didn’t we, Laura? But how wonderfully well
you look, darling! We are all ready to go on
pilgrimage to the shrine of St. Barrington Hope,
as it seems he has wrought all these miracles.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, indeed, dear old dad,” cried Laura;
“I would have put up his image in my bedroom,
and done a little private worship if I had
had the least idea of what he was like. But
you never vouchsafed any sketch of his personal
appearance. You haven’t brought a photo,
have you? That would be something.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Barrington Hope is a very fine man,
pussy, as you will see probably, one of these
days—a good deal out of the common in every
respect.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>“Young, is he?” queried Linda, who, having
climbed on her father’s knee, was patting
his face and smoothing his hair. “He isn’t a
horrid old man, or married? Good gracious!
we never thought of that, did we? Oh! don’t
say he is bald or grey, or unromantic. Laura
and I would never get over it. We have fixed
on him for our hero, like Guy in the <cite>Heir of
Redclyffe</cite>. Surely some one said he was young!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is a good deal more like Philip, but
there is nothing of the prig about him, as I fear
there was about that estimable young man,”
replied her father. “But what does his personal
appearance matter, I should like to know?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But it <em>does</em>, it matters everything,” returned
the enthusiastic damsel. “Oh! he can’t be
plain, surely not—after all he has done for us.
You mustn’t knock down the romance we have
all been building up.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is a very fine man, a few years older
than Hubert, that is all. I can’t give any inventory
of his features, but he is tall and distinguished
looking. Isn’t that enough?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! splendid!” Here Linda clapped her
hands in childish glee. “Fate is too kind! Our
preserver is all that we could wish. Nothing
was wanting but that. We are the happiest
family in New South Wales—in the world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Amen!” said Mr. Stamford. “Now you
may unlock my portmanteau and turn out a
few presents I have brought my little girls. I
shall be ready for lunch when it comes in, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>may venture to remark. The bush air is still
keen, I perceive.”</p>

<p class='c017'>In accordance with his well-studied programme,
Mr. Stamford informed his family, in
general terms, that the arrangements he had
made with Mr. Barrington Hope were of a
satisfactory description. That gentleman had
behaved most liberally and courteously in all
respects. The rain having so fortunately arrived
on the top of all this, had enabled him
even to improve on his first terms, which were
nearly all that could be wished. They would
therefore be warranted in allowing themselves a
few indulgences such as, had the season continued
dry, could not have been so much as
thought of.</p>

<p class='c017'>After lunch, or rather dinner, the mid-day
meal being of that unfashionable description,
Mr. Stamford and Hubert took a long drive
round the run. The appearance of the pastures,
as also of the sheep they encountered, was such
as to draw forth exclamations of surprise and
delight from their possessor.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I never remember such a season since the
year I bought the run,” he remarked to his son.
“You were quite a little fellow then, and Laura
hardly able to walk. It puts me quite in mind
of old times—of the happy days which I
thought had fled for ever.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, please goodness, governor, we’ll
knock something out of the old place this year
that will make up for past losses. Sheep are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>rising fast, and, as we can’t help having a fine
lambing and a good clip, you’ll see what we’ll
rake in. We must put up a new washpen,
though, and enlarge the shed a bit. It won’t
cost much, as I’ve put a first-rate man on. He’s
a Swede, been a ship’s carpenter, and the
quickest worker, when he understands what
you want done, that I ever saw. Not one of
your cabinet-making humbugs who are all day
morticing a gate-head. I’ll draw in all the
round stuff, and you’ll see how soon we’ll
knock it up.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All right, my boy; any improvements in
reason, only we mustn’t spend all our money
before we make it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Trust me for that, dad; you won’t find me
spending a penny that can be saved. We shall
want no extra hands till shearing time. All the
paddocks are right and tight, so the sheep will
shepherd themselves, and do all the better, too.
How jolly it is to have no bother about water,
isn’t it? And what a bit of luck we had that
dam in the hill paddock finished just before the
rain came.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nothing like doing things at the right
time, Hubert,” replied Mr. Stamford, with an
air of oracular wisdom. “You had half a mind
to leave that same dam till next year.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, I must confess I hadn’t much heart to
go shovelling and picking that gravelly clay—hard
as iron—with the weather so hot too, and
looking as if rain was never coming again. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>you were right to have it done, and now we
have the benefit of it. Got a pretty fair
paddock of oats in too. It’s coming up
splendidly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How did you manage that without a
team?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hired a carrier’s for a week or two. He
was short of cash, and wanted to spell his
bullocks; besides we ripped over the ploughing
in no time. Then I made a brush harrow and
finished it with the station horses. The main
thing was to get in the seed the first break of
dry weather, and now we shall have a stack
that will last us two years at least.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well done, my boy; dry seasons will come
again some day; we must prepare for them,
though everything looks so bright, or rather so
delightfully cloudy, just now. We shall have
to invent a fresh set of proverbs to suit Australia,
shall we not, instead of using our old-fashioned
English ones?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, indeed. Can anything be more ludicrous
than ‘Save up for a rainy day?’ ‘Look ahead
in case of a dry season,’ should be our motto.
This carrier was rather a smart chap, and understood
similes. ‘Will that bullock go steady on
the near side?’ I asked him the other day.
‘Oh! he’s right,’ he said; ‘right as rain!’
That was something like, wasn’t it? By the
bye, dad, you didn’t forget those books of mine,
did you?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, my son! I bought a few more in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>addition. In fact, there’s a box of books
coming up by the train.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“A box of books! Hurrah! What times
we shall have, when the evenings get longer.
But, I say, dad! isn’t that rather extravagant?
You’ll have the mater on to you if you begin
to buy books by the box.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They will have to last us some time,
Hubert; you will find a good deal of stiff
reading among them. But if things go well
generally, I won’t stint you in books. We
must charge them to the rain account this
time.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose we can save out of something
else, but I really have found it hard, the last year
or two, to do without a new book now and
then. It’s so tantalising to see the names and
read the reviews when you’re not able to get
them. But of course it couldn’t be helped
when things looked so bad.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have a notion, Hubert, that things will
never look so bad again. However, we must
not be led away by temporary good fortune. Perseverance
is, after all, the great secret of success.
Without that mere cleverness is misleading, and
even mischievous.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was so far fortunate for Mr. Stamford, and
it certainly made his allotted task the easier, that
he had always been somewhat reticent as to
business details.</p>

<p class='c017'>They were subjects concerning which he disliked
conversation extremely, so that although
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>he confided in his wife and family as to every
change in their pecuniary position, he was wont
to ignore special explanation, much more the
repetition of detail.</p>

<p class='c017'>When he announced therefore in general
terms, from time to time, to his family that
things were going well, and that Mr. Barrington
Hope’s financial plan, coupled with that extraordinary
advance in the value of pastoral property
occasioned by the rain, enabled him to raise the
standard of their house-keeping, they were satisfied,
and did not press for further information.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now commenced for Harold Stamford the
ideal country life towards which he had always
aspired, but from which, latterly, he had been
further removed than ever. He enjoyed the
advantages of the dweller away from cities without
the drawbacks which so often tend to render
that idyllic life monotonous and depressing.</p>

<p class='c017'>He had daily outdoor exercise in sufficient
quantity to produce the wholesome half-tired
feeling so necessary to repose.</p>

<p class='c017'>At the same time, he was entirely freed from
dominant and engrossing dread, a state of mind
which had for years past coloured so large a
portion of his waking thoughts. How hard it had
been to fall asleep with endless plans coursing
through his tired brain, having for their central
idea the admitted fact of bankruptcy. How were
they to act? What was there to support the
family while he sought for employment? Employment,
too! To what occupation could he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>betake himself, now that middle age was reached,
and much of the vigour and activity of manhood
departed? He had acquired “experience.”
There was a grim irony in the expression—of
what use would it be to him without capital?
A managership of the station of another? True
that might be possibly attained after weeks and
months of effort, or years, as the case might be.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was familiar with the appearance of
saddened men who haunted the offices of stock-agents
and merchants—the waiting-rooms of
bankers, the steps of clubs whence their more
prosperous comrades walked forth redolent of
solvency. He had noticed such men growing
shabbier, more hopeless of aspect as the months
rolled on. He had heard them alluded to with
contemptuous pity as “Poor old So-and-so! Not
up to much now, younger and smarter men to
be had,” &amp;c. He had wondered whether such
might be his fate, whether with his fall he should
drag down those beloved ones, who, whatever
might be the trials they had undergone together,
had always enjoyed the fullest personal freedom
and independence.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such dreary reflections had been his companions
in the past—daily, hourly, as well under
the light of the sun as in the night watches,
when silence lends to every reproach of conscience,
every signal of danger, a treble force and
distinctness.</p>

<p class='c017'>In those terrible years of doubt and dread,
of ruin and despair, what tragedies had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>enacted before his eyes, among his friends and
comrades, dwellers in the same region, dependent
upon the same seasons, betrayed by the same
natural causes! But the other men had not,
like him, been shielded by the soft encircling
influence of a happy home. A logical mind, a
sanguine spirit, combined with a philosophical
habit, had perhaps proved his safeguard. However
that might be, and Harold Stamford was
the last man to boast to himself or to others, his
bark had battled with the angry waters while
others had become dismal wrecks, or had foundered
suddenly and irrevocably.</p>

<p class='c017'>Despair had written its tale in the chronicles
of the district, in reckless deep drinking, in
suicide, in brain-ruin.</p>

<p class='c017'>All these things had he seen and known of.
From these and other evils, not less deadly, but
of slower effect, had he been preserved.</p>

<p class='c017'>When he looked around and saw himself on
a pinnacle of prosperity, safe in the possession
of all that he held most dear—the lands he had
so loved—the life of labour and of leisure so
happily apportioned, which he had so fully
appreciated—the assured position of respect and
consideration, which it is not in mortal man
wholly to undervalue, he could with difficulty
restrain his feelings. His heart swelled with
thankfulness to that Supreme Ruler who had so
mercifully ordered all matters concerning him
and his, and again he vowed so to shape his
future life that he might be held in some degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>worthy of the blessings which had been showered
upon him all unworthy.</p>

<p class='c017'>This adjustment of ways and means he found
nearly as difficult in its way as the former trial.
He often smiled to himself as he found what an
amount of conscientious reluctance to accept the
unwonted plenty he was compelled to combat.
Did he effect a surprise of a few rare plants for
his flower-loving wife, she would calculate the
railway charges, and ask gravely if he was sure
he could afford it. Did he order a new riding-habit
for Laura, a hat or a summer dress for
Linda, they were sure they could make the old
ones do for another season. It was interesting
to watch the conflict between the natural, girlish
eagerness for the new and desirable and the
inner voice which had so long cried “refrain,
refrain!” in that sorely tried household.</p>

<p class='c017'>However, in spite of their virtuous resistance,
by the exercise of a little diplomacy, Harold
Stamford had his way. The garden was dug
over, the trees were pruned, the parterre refilled
with choice varieties of the old loved flowers
that the drought had slain. Even a bush-house
and a fernery were managed—put up indeed by
the man who had been temporarily retained as
gardener, and whom Mrs. Stamford, deeply as
she appreciated the enjoyment of once more
beholding trim alleys and well-tended beds,
could not help regarding in the light of a
superfluity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then there was the American buggy, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>wonderful vehicle, in which so many journeys
had been made over roads that were rough or
smooth, ways that were short or long, as need
was, wherein all the family had been closely
packed in the days of their childhood, still
strong and serviceable, but woefully deficient in
paint and varnish. This family friend, and a
friend in need had it been, found its way to the
coachmaker’s, whence it issued resplendent,
nearly as distinguished in appearance, Mrs.
Stamford conceded, as when, in the earlier days
of their wedded life, they had been secretly
proud of their handsome carriage and well-matched,
fast-trotting pair.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It quite brought back,” she averred, “the
old days of love in a cottage, with all their
precious memories.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Gradually, and unobtrusively, was the master
of the establishment enabled to compass these
and other desirable repairs and refittings. All
things that had become shabby were dismissed
or replaced after the same piecemeal manner.
As time wore on, the process ceased to alarm his
wife or children, more especially as, aided by
the bounteous season and Hubert’s ceaseless
energy, the general prosperity of the station was
marked and gratifying.</p>

<p class='c017'>The increase of the stock was unexampled.
The anxious, toilsome period of shearing was
passed successfully.</p>

<p class='c017'>The new washpen answered beyond the most
sanguine anticipation. The clip was heavy, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“got up” so as almost to resemble raw silk—a
pardonable exaggeration—so free from dust and
all contamination had sleepless vigilance and
care on Hubert’s part “turned it out.” The
crop was as “high as the fence,” Maurice
averred, and the haystack, consequently, a
colossal and imposing pile of fragrant fodder.
The spring was sufficiently showery to lay the
dust and keep the matted grass green at the
roots. Water was abundant, both “out back”
as well as on the frontage. “All went merry as
a marriage bell,” and when the last high-piled
waggon-load had moved slowly away, on which
was imprinted “Windāhgil, First Combing,
348,” with other suggestive and satisfactory
legends, Mr. Stamford put his arm round his
wife’s waist, and remarked, “My dear, I think a
trip to Sydney would do you and the girls so
much good. As I am compelled to see Mr.
Hope on business, we may as well all go
together.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The thrill of pleasure with which this proposal
was received showed itself in the flushing
cheeks and brightened eyes of Laura and her
sister—while upon Mrs. Stamford’s features an
almost pathetic expression appeared, as of a
revelation of joy sudden and unhoped-for.
“You are so kind, Harold; but, oh! are you
prudent? Think of the expense—new dresses,
new everything, indeed! Why it seems an age
since I saw Sydney!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Think of the clip, Mrs. Stamford,” retorted
her husband. “Think of the lambs, think of
the fat sheep ready for market. Your journey
to town will be the merest trifle of expenditure
compared to what we can lawfully and reasonably
afford. I speak in sober earnest. Besides,
the Intercolonial Exhibition is open. The girls
may never have such another chance. Hubert
must stay at home for fear of bush fires. He
shall have his holiday when we return. So,
girls, the great Windāhgil migration is settled.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The departure for the metropolis of a family
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>that has long dwelt in the “bush,” or veritable
far country division of Australian life, is an event
of no ordinary magnitude.</p>

<p class='c017'>Not that the conditions of their rural life are
so widely different from those in England.
There is the country town within reasonable
distance, to which visits are by no means infrequent.
There reside the clergymen, lawyers,
doctors, bankers, teachers, and tradespeople, the
chief component parts of rural society—as in
England. There are also various retired non-combatants,
decayed gentry and others, the poor
and proud section—as in Europe. The squirearchy
is represented by large-acred, wealthy personages,
who have either acquired or inherited
estates, exceeding ten- or twenty-fold in value
those of average proprietors—as in Europe.
These great people are frequently absent, but
contribute fairly by a higher scale of expenditure,
often comprising picture-galleries, and
valuable collections of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>objets d’art</em></span>, generally to
the mental advancement of the neighbourhood.
It is not to be supposed, either, that they are
for the most part uneducated or unrefined.</p>

<p class='c017'>It follows, therefore, that even when deprived
of access to metropolitan luxuries, the families
of rural colonists are not wholly without intellectual
privileges, invariable as has been the
custom of the British novelist to depict them
as living a rude, unpolished, and wholly unlettered
life.</p>

<p class='c017'>In ordinary seasons it is the custom for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>squatters of a certain rank to visit the sea coast
with their families once a year, if not oftener.
The pleasures of city life are then moderately
partaken of, fresh ideas are acquired, old tastes
are indulged; friendships are contracted, repaired,
or revived. Mental and physical benefits
unspecified are acquired, and after a few weeks’
absence the country family returns, much contented
with their experiences, but perfectly resigned
to await the changing year’s recurrence ere
such another momentous journeying takes place.</p>

<p class='c017'>But when, as at Windāhgil, a succession of
untoward seasons brings the family ark well-nigh
to wreck and ruin, it is obvious that no
such holiday-making can be thought of. “Certainly
not this year, perhaps not next year,” says
Paterfamilias, sorrowfully, but firmly. Then
doubtless all the reserves are called up; steady,
instructive reading must take the place of travel,
old acquaintances whose minds, so to speak, have
been read through and through, and dog’s-eared
besides, must perforce be endured through lack
of charmingly-new fresh romantically-respectful
strangers. The old dresses are turned and returned,
freshly trimmed, and their terms of
service lengthened by every economical device,
pathetic in the patience and true homely virtue
displayed. But though all these substitutes
and makeshifts are availed of, the time <em>does</em> pass
a little wearily and monotonously.</p>

<p class='c017'>But now the “route was given,” the delightful
signal had sounded. The sudden change of ideas
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>necessitated by the announcement of Mr. Stamford
was at first bewildering to his wife, and
nearly in an equal degree to his daughters.</p>

<p class='c017'>Calculation and arrangement were required;
much forecasting as to where they were to
go first, when they could possibly be ready to
start, maternal doubts as to what poor Hubert
would do in their absence, as the maids would
necessarily return to their friends. These
weighty considerations absorbed so much time
and thought that it was generally agreed to be a
species of miracle by which the family found themselves
safely packed in the waggonette one
memorable Monday on the way to Mooarmah
railway station, the luggage having been sent on
in the early morning.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor dear Hubert, it seems so selfish to
leave him at home by himself,” said Laura;
“I think one of us ought to have stayed to
keep house for him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s not too late now,” said Linda. “Which
is it to be? Shall we toss up? I’m quite ready,
if I lose.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No! I will stay,” said Laura. “I’m the
eldest.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think I will stop after all,” said Mrs.
Stamford. “You two girls are due for a little
enjoyment, and it does not matter so much
about me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You will do nothing of the sort,” said Mr.
Stamford, with rather more emphasis than usual.
“Your mother wants a change as much as any
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>of us. It’s very good of you girls to be ready
to remain, and it pleases me, my dears. But
Hubert is man enough to look after himself, as
well as the station, for a month or two. When
our holiday is up, his will begin.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“As if I would have let anybody stop,” said
Hubert, “let alone the dear mater; bless her
old heart! And how am I going to do
when I go to the ‘Never-Never’ country, do
you suppose—and I must have a turn there
some day—if you all coddle me up so?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope you never will go to that dreadful
new country,” said Mrs. Stamford, half-tearfully.
“Didn’t you read that shocking account of the
poor fellow who died of thirst by the telegraph
line the other day, besides that nice young
Belford who was killed by the blacks?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Accidents will happen,” said Hubert. “The
British Empire wouldn’t be what it is, if every
mother kept her boy at home so that she could
see him, while she knitted his warm socks.
Windāhgil is paying fairly now, but there’s no
fortune to be made here, is there, governor?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I didn’t know that you were growing
discontented with your lot, my boy,” said the
father, looking admiringly at his first-born;
“but there’s time enough to think about all
that. I’ll see when we are all settled at home
again. There goes the bell; we must take our
places. God bless you, my boy!”</p>

<p class='c017'>The following morning found the Stamford
family comfortably deposited in one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>hotels which in Sydney combine proximity to
the sea with perfect accessibility from all city
centres. Bath and breakfast had removed all
traces of fatigue or travelling discomfort. Laura,
with her sister, was standing at a window which
overlooked the sea, wild with delight at the
unaccustomed glory of the ocean.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! what a lovely, lovely sight!” cried
Linda. “Look at that glorious bay, with those
white-winged boats flying across it like sea-gulls—it’s
an old simile, I know, but it always
sounds nice. Look at the rocks and promontories,
beaches and islands! And there, a great
ocean liner is moving majestically along, as if
she was going to steam up to the verandah.
Wouldn’t it be nice if she did! I wonder what
the people would be like? Oh! I shall expire
with joy and wonder if I stay here much
longer.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then put on your bonnet, and come to
George Street with me,” said Mrs. Stamford.
“I want to do a little quiet shopping before
lunch. Laura can stay with her father. He is
going to take her to see the Grandisons.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! how nice; I haven’t seen a real shop,”
said Linda, “like Palmer’s and David Bowen’s,
you know, since I was a little girl. That will tone
the excitement down a little, or give it a new
direction. Oh, I <em>do</em> feel so happy! Do you think
it will last, mother? It can’t be any better in
England—or Fairyland. The world does not
offer anything superior to my present feeling of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>perfect—yes, perfect happiness. Don’t let us go
to the opera for a week yet, till I have had time
to subside. I feel like a glass of champagne; I
should effervesce over. La! la, la, la! la, la, la!
la, la!” And here the excited girl waltzed
into her bed-room to the tune of “The
Venetia.”</p>

<p class='c017'>When Mrs. Stamford and her youngest
daughter departed on their shopping expedition,
the latter declaring that she felt the greatest
difficulty in restraining herself from bursting
into song from pure gladsomeness of heart, her
father betook himself in a cab with Laura to
Mr. Grandison’s house, where he proposed to
leave her with her cousin Josie till his return in
the evening. Laura was little less inwardly
delighted with her general surroundings than
Linda, but not being so highly demonstrative,
she forbore to testify her pleasure by bodily
movement. Yet was her heart filled with innocent
joy and honest admiration as she surveyed
the unwonted scene.</p>

<p class='c017'>As their carriage wound slowly up one of
the steep ascents by which, on leaving the city
proper, the more fashionable suburbs are
reached, her dark eyes sparkled and her fair
cheek glowed while she pointed out the fresh
combination of sea and shore.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, father!” she said, “when you look on
this, does it not seem strange that any one
should choose to live away from the sea? I
should spend half my time on the beach!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>What changeful beauty! What new wonders
arise, even from this tiny outlook! Nothing can
be more delicious than this harbour, with gardens
and lawns down to the very ends of the promontories.
The dear little bays too, like fairy
pictures, with smooth shores, and a big rock
with an archway here and there. And oh! the
Heads! Grand and majestic, are they not?—frowning
above the restless deep like eternal
ocean portals. I can see billows, I declare. How
vast and awe-striking! I am really thankful
we haven’t been to Sydney all these bad seasons.
A day like this is worth a year of common
life.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s an extravagant price to pay for a
day’s pleasure, pussy,” said her father fondly, as
he watched the fire of enthusiasm glow in the
girl’s bright eyes, which seemed to dilate and
sparkle at intervals as if the glory of the grand
vision had been transfused into her very blood.
“You will count your years, as other people
count their money, much more carefully as you
grow older. But I trust, pet, that you will
have long years of happiness before you, and
that this is not the only one of earth’s precious
things that you will enjoy.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a divine pleasure travel must be!”
said she, gazing steadfastly before her, as if
looking out on a new world of wonder and
enchantment. “Think of seeing, with one’s
own very eyes, the cities and battle-fields of the
earth, the shrines of the dead, immortal past!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>Oh! to see Rome and Venice, Athens and the
Greek Isles, even dear old England with Saxon
ruins and Norman castles. I wonder it does not
kill people.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Happiness is rarely fatal, though the sensation
of sudden joy is often overpowering,” remarked
Mr. Stamford with a quiet smile, as he
recalled his own recent experience. “But I
hope you and Linda will qualify yourselves by
study for an intelligent appreciation of the
marvels of the Old World. That is,”—he added—“in
the event of your being fortunate
enough to get there. ‘We colonists have a great
deal to learn in art and literature,’ as Lord
Kimberley was pleased to say the other day.
We must show that we are not altogether without
a glimmering of taste and attainment.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That is the fixed British idea about all
colonists,” said Laura with indignation. “I
suppose Lord Kimberley thinks we do nothing
but chop down trees and gallop about all day
long. Well, one mustn’t boast, but we have
been getting on with our French and Italian
lately, and Linda’s sketches show something
more than amateur work, I think.”</p>

<p class='c017'>When they drew up at Chatsworth, and the
cabman was opening the gold and bronze-coloured
iron gates, Laura’s ecstasies broke out
anew.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! father, do look; did you ever see
such a beautiful place? Look at the gravel,
look at the flowers, look at the sea which makes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>a background for the whole picture! Look at
that purple mass of <em>Bougainvillea</em> covering all
one side of the house. Why the lawn is like a
big billiard table! It is a morsel of Fairyland.
How happy they must be in such a lovely home!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Humph!” said Mr. Stamford, “perhaps
the less we say about that the better. The
people that live in the best houses do not always
lead the pleasantest lives. But it certainly is a
show place.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was truly difficult to overpraise the Chatsworth
house and grounds. Nature had been
bountiful, and every beauty was heightened,
every trifling defect corrected by art.</p>

<p class='c017'>The gravel of which the drive was composed
was in itself a study—its dark red colour, its
perfect condition, daily raked and rolled as it
was to the smoothness of a board. Rare shrubs
and massed flowers bordered the accurately
defined tiled edges. The bright blue blossoms
of the <em>Jacaranda</em>, the scarlet stars of the
<em>Hibiscus</em>, the broad purple and green leaves of
the <em>Coleus</em>, the waving, restless spires of the pine,
the rustling, delicate banana fronds—all these
and a host of tropical plants which the mild
Sydney winter suffers to flourish in the open
air, were here. Fountains, tennis-grounds, and
shaded walks, all were to be found in the tiny
demesne, every yard of which had been measured
and calculated so as to produce the largest
amount of effect and convenience.</p>

<p class='c017'>The hot-house and green-houses were under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>the care of an autocratic Scotch gardener, who
treated Mr. Grandison’s suggestions with silent
contempt, and obeyed or defied Mrs. Grandison’s
orders as to fruit or flowers entirely as it seemed
good to him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Grandison was at home. The footman
admitted so much, as he asked the country cousins
into a morning room—a most grand apartment
to their eyes; nevertheless, Mrs. Grandison’s
countenance—she was there alone—wore a
clouded and dissatisfied expression. She relaxed
considerably, though with an effort, as her
visitors were announced, and came forward to
greet them warmly enough.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So glad to see you, Mr. Stamford. It was
nice of you to bring Laura. Why you look as
fresh as a rose, child! How do you manage
to have such a complexion in a hot district? I
tell Josie she is getting as pale as a ghost, and
yellow too. The fact is, she goes out too much,
and this Sydney climate is enough to age any
one. She hasn’t been down to breakfast yet—naughty
girl—but she was at the Moreton’s
ball last night. Mrs. Watchtower took her,
and she didn’t get home till past four o’clock.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose Grandison’s in town,” said Mr.
Stamford.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! yes; he goes in regularly every day,
though I often tell him I don’t know what
he has to do. He lunches at his club; you’ll
find him there at one o’clock. He says it’s dull
enough there, but nothing to what it would be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>if he stopped at home. Not very complimentary,
is it? But men are all alike; they like
to get away from their wives and families.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ve brought mine with me, you see, this
time; so I don’t fall under your disapproval.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! I do think you’re pretty good, as men
go, though there’s no knowing. But, Laura,
you’d better go up to Josie’s room, if you want
to have a talk, or else you may have to wait.
Now, Mr. Stamford, when will you all come
and dine? To-day you’ll be tired—to-morrow
or next day, which shall it be—and we’ll have
somebody to make it a little lively for the
girls?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank you. I think the day after to-morrow,
if it is equally convenient,” said Stamford. “And
now I must go, as I have some business to attend
to. I will leave Laura, with your permission, and
call for her as I return in the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! yes, by all means. Josie will enjoy a
long talk with her. What a fine girl she has
grown, and so handsome too! She wants dressing
a bit. But how does she manage to get all
that fine bloom in the bush? I thought Windāhgil
was a hot place, yet Laura looks as fresh
as a milkmaid.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She is a good girl, and has had very little
dissipation. We lead very simple lives in the
bush, you know. My daughters are very unsophisticated
as yet.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s all very well, but being simple
doesn’t give beauty or style, and Laura seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to have a very fair share of both. You let her
come to the Assembly Ball next week that all
the girls are talking about, and see what a
sensation she’ll make.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If there’s a ball while we are down I should
not think of denying the girls a legitimate
pleasure, though Linda is rather young yet;
but I think you flatter Laura.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not a bit. It’s her fresh, natural manner
that will strike everybody, and the way all her
face seems to speak without words. Her eyes
are perfectly wonderful. Why didn’t you tell
us she was such a beauty, and had a charming
manner?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“To my mind, it’s rather a disadvantage
than otherwise—the beauty—not the manner,
of course,” said Mr. Stamford philosophically.
“I beg you won’t inform her of the fact,
though I really don’t think she’d believe you,
my dear Mrs. Grandison. But I must go now,
so good-bye for the present.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is nearly lunch time now,” said Mrs.
Grandison; “you may as well stay, and go to
town afterwards.” But Mr. Stamford pleaded
“urgent private affairs,” and notwithstanding
the temptress—who began to look forward
to a lonely meal, with the two girls chatting
in the bed-room, and was fain to fall back
on even a middle-aged squatter—he sought
his cab.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford looked at his watch; it wanted
more than half an hour to one o’clock. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>bade his cabman drive briskly, and was landed
at the palatial offices of the Austral Agency
Company in reasonable time. He dashed into
Barrington Hope’s sanctuary with something
like boyish enthusiasm. That gentleman raised
his head from a pile of accounts, and to Mr.
Stamford’s eyes looked even more careworn and
fagged than at his last visit.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How are you, Mr. Stamford?” he said,
with a sudden brightening up of the weary
features. “But I needn’t ask. You’re a
different man from what you were when our
acquaintance commenced. And no wonder.
Talk about physicians! Rain is the king of
them all. Tell me a healer, a preserver like
him! What a grand season you have had, to be
sure—the precursor of many others, I hope.
The Windāhgil wool brought a high price,
didn’t it? Splendidly got up; every one said
so. Bought for the French market. It made a
character for the brand, if one was wanted. But
all this is gossip. You wanted to say something
on business.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not now,” said Mr. Stamford; “‘sufficient
for the day,’ and so on. We only reached
Sydney this morning. But I have a piece of
very particular business. I want you to come
down and dine with us, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en famille</em></span>, at Batty’s
this evening. Brought my wife and daughters
down. They’re anxious to make your acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Delighted, I’m sure. I hope the ladies will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>find Sydney amusing. There’s nothing going
on particularly, except a Bachelors’ Ball next
week, of which I happen to be a steward. Perhaps
you will allow me to send you invitations.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can answer for their being accepted,” said
Mr. Stamford, “as far as my daughters are concerned.
Their parents are rather old to do
more than look on. But I will promise to do
that energetically. And now I will not bother
you longer. You have a stiff bit of work before
you there. Don’t knock yourself up, that’s all.
There’s such a thing as overdoing these confounded
figure columns, and when a cogwheel
goes, Nature’s workshop provides no duplicate.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I understand you,” said Hope, pressing his
hand with a quick gesture to his forehead. “I
<em>have</em> felt rather run down lately. The business
has been increasing at a tremendous rate, too.
I must take a holiday before long, though I don’t
quite see my way.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Come and see us at Windāhgil,” said Mr.
Stamford warmly. “The fresh bush air and a
gallop on horseback will set you right again.
That’s all you want. We must talk about it.
In the meantime, adieu.” And Mr. Stamford
vanished.</p>

<p class='c017'>He reached his hotel in time for lunch, where
he found Mrs. Stamford and Linda, who had
returned from their expedition into the heart of
the kingdom of finery.</p>

<p class='c017'>Linda declared that she had never comprehended
the subject before—never was aware
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>that she knew nothing, so to speak, of this all-engrossing
subject, so important in all its details
to womanhood. “I can quite imagine people
with lots of money going to any lengths in the
way of dress,” she said. “The variety is so
charming, and the milliners are so persuasive.
How that dear little girl at Farmer’s tried
to get me to take the silk dress. Didn’t she,
mother?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was afraid she would succeed at one time,
my dear; you appeared to be hesitating.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should have liked it, of course. Such
a lovely lilac. It suited my complexion perfectly,
she said; but I knew my allowance
wouldn’t stand it, and you have been so good,
my dear old dad. I don’t want you and mother
to think I can’t resist temptation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Act on steady principles through life, my
dear, and you will never regret it. I don’t
say the silk dresses and other suitable vanities
may not come in time, but not just yet, not yet
for my little girls. And now for the reward of
merit. Mr. Hope is coming to dine with us
this evening, so you and Laura must entertain
him pleasantly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, what a delightful surprise! Sydney is
full of them. Of course I knew we should see
him some time or other, but perhaps not for
ever so long, unless he called. I wonder if
he will be like my impression of him? Does
Laura know of it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not until I go for her, unless you would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>like to send her a telegram; but I think she
will have full time for preparation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a pity it will be if they keep her at
Chatsworth! They are sure to want to. But
don’t you give in, if they do ever so much.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“There will be the less necessity for that, my
dear Linda, as we are all to dine there on the
day after to-morrow. They can feast their eyes
on Laura and all the family then.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That is surprise number two. A real dinner-party!
It will be my first invitation to one. I
hope I shall behave well, and not upset my wine-glass
or do anything dreadful. I shall be looking
at the butler or the hostess, or the attractive
guests, I know, and break something. I think
I shall begin to practise calm dignity to-night,
mother. Don’t you think it a good
opportunity?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If my little girl remembers what she has
always been taught,” said the fond mother,
looking at the girlish, eager face, bright with
the hues of early womanhood, “and will not
think about herself, or the effect she is likely to
produce, she will do very well. I don’t think
we shall have cause to be ashamed of her. And
now for a little luncheon. My appetite is
really quite surprising.”</p>

<p class='c017'>After lunch Mr. Stamford betook himself to
the Archaic Club, where it was tolerably certain
his friend would be found, for an hour or two.
By the way, how very few married men return
to their homes, even those of abounding leisure,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>before it is time to dress for dinner. They
will sit yawning at a club, when they have
nothing to do, where they care for nobody, and
don’t go in for reading or even play billiards,
until the late afternoon, when there is just time
to catch a cab or train to reach home in the
gathering twilight.</p>

<p class='c017'>How, then, can these things be? The solution
of this and other social problems must
be left to the coming philosophical student, who
will analyse and depict the causes of all seeming
anomalies.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Stamford, on inquiring of the club
porter, found that his friend was at home, so to
speak, and had not been more than ten minutes
in an apartment very unostentatiously furnished,
which was devoted to the reception of strangers,
when Mr. Grandison entered.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Are you club magnates afraid that strangers
may run away with a chair or two, or a spare
sofa, that you are so confoundedly parsimonious
in the furniture line?” inquired Stamford. “I
have more than once considered the question
when I have been kicking my heels here and at
the Junior Pioneers, and that is the conclusion
I have arrived at. It must be so. Surely there
must be a legend of a dried-out squatter being
driven to spout an arm-chair or a table-cover.
Isn’t that it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’re in famous spirits, Harold, old man,”
said the capitalist, who was by no means over-joyous
of demeanour. “It’s the rain that’s done
it, I suppose. ’Pon my soul, you’re right about
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>this room. It isn’t fit for a gentleman to be
put into. I must bring it before the committee.
How are Mrs. Stamford and the girls? Brought
them down?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, we’re at Batty’s. I took Laura to
Chatsworth this morning; I’m going out now
to call for her. I saw Mrs. Grandison; she
was kind enough to ask us to dine on Thursday.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s all right. Now I’ll tell you what
I’ll do. The mail-phaeton will be here in five
minutes, and we’ll go out home together. I
want to have a talk with you. Things are not
going altogether right in the family, and I want
another good yarn with you. You know what
I told you about Carlo? Well, he’s done worse
since then, pretty near broke my heart and his
mother’s.” And here Mr. Grandison looked so
worried and hopeless that his friend felt himself
to be grossly selfish in that he found himself in
such good spirits.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m very sorry to hear it, Bob, my dear
fellow,” said he with real concern. “But worse!
how can he have done worse?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He <em>has</em> done worse, much worse. He has
married, and married badly too, by Jingo!” and
here Mr. Grandison could no longer contain
himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hate to talk about it,” said he, after a
pause, “but it’s one of those things that must
be faced. And of course you and I are too old
friends to mind telling each other the whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>truth. But the fact is, the confounded young
fool has gone and married a barmaid.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You don’t say so!” said Mr. Stamford,
starting back as from a blow, but gradually
bringing his mind to bear on the question, and
wondering how the consequences and complication
of such an inconceivable step in the case of
an eldest son would end. “Carlo a married
man! And to a barmaid too! Surely there
must be some mistake. How in the world did
it happen—how could it happen?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose it could happen, because it did,”
answered his friend gloomily. “Unfortunately,
it’s only too true. The fact is, that while he
was living in Tasmania—you know he had just
gone there when you were in Sydney last, after
that card-scrape he got into here—he was living
an idle, aimless life. He did that here, for that
matter, so that there was no need for him to
complain about it so bitterly. I sent him a very
fair allowance, and thought he was well out of
harm’s way. He used to write his mother long
letters; I thought he was on the way to be
reformed.” Here Mr. Grandison lit a cigar.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What happened then?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“After that he wanted me to give him an
allowance, and let him go to Europe. I wish
to heaven I had done so now!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But why didn’t you?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Because I couldn’t trust him. I knew if I
let him go on that understanding, he would
overdraw his allowance—gamble on a large scale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>at some of those foreign places—Baden Baden
or Homburg. Blow his brains out then,
perhaps.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should have let him go, but I can understand
your very natural reluctance.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, he’s a bad boy, Stamford, there’s no
denying. But he’s my eldest son, my first
child. My God! how I remember all the love
and fondness poor Mary and I lavished on him—how
we fretted ourselves to death when he
had any childish complaint—the agony we were
in when he was away from home one night, we
thought he was lost. And to think he should
have repaid us for all our care and love, perhaps
foolish indulgence, like this—like this! It’s
very bitter; it’s hard to bear. Dashed if I
didn’t envy our gardener last week, whose son
was apprenticed to a blacksmith! I did, by
Jove! What’s all the money to us now?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is hard, my dear fellow,” said Stamford,
touched by his friend’s evident distress and
hopeless air. “I pity you from my heart.
But are things so very bad? Can nothing be
done?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well they might be worse. The girl’s
character is good, I believe; she is a dairyman’s
daughter, with no education, and that’s all the
harm I know of her. She has a pretty face.
Carlo met her at a roadside inn near where he
was lodging. He writes over and says he was
so confoundedly dull and miserable that he’d
made up his mind he’d either marry the girl if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>she’d have him, or shoot himself. She did have
him. So this is the end of all our slaving and
striving for his benefit and to give him a chance
of keeping in the first flight of the best society
the colony could show. He goes and throws
himself away like this. And we have a
daughter-in-law that doesn’t know an aitch
when she sees it, I suppose, and if ever she
comes here, which isn’t likely, perhaps, can’t
tell a finger-glass from a flower-pot.” At this
dreadful picture evoked from his inner consciousness,
Mr. Grandison groaned again, and
made as if he could tear his hair, were such
gestures of grief permissible in a member of a
fashionable club.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford did not really know for the
moment what to say to console the unhappy
father, who, unless his son had died, could
hardly have been in a position of more hopeless
sorrow. No doubt some fathers would have
been sufficiently Spartan to have preferred an
honourable death to an undesirable marriage.
But, except in business matters, he was not a
hard man. Stamford knew that such Lacedæmonian
severity was alien to his nature. He
set himself to suggest consolatory ideas as the
London built phaeton drew up to the club
steps.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s a bad enough affair, doubtless. I won’t
say I don’t think so. I should have felt all
you do, in my own case.” Here Mr. Stamford
inwardly scoffed at the possibility of Hubert’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>acting in this manner under any possible circumstances.
“But it’s no use taking too sombre a
view. The girl is good looking, and honest,
which is much. She will, doubtless improve
with opportunities. If she has any strength of
character, she will probably keep Carlo straight
for the future. We have known such things
happen before. It’s a desperate remedy, but
occasionally efficacious.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Desperate! You may say so,” replied Mr.
Grandison, testily. “Take the other side of
the question. Suppose she turns out a flirt or a
scold—or both; runs away from him, or he
from her, leaving three or four half-bred brats
to worry me in my old age. What then?”</p>

<p class='c017'>With the expression of these gloomy
apprehensions as to the probable matrimonial
fate of the heir apparent of Chatsworth and
many a fair acre of plain and woodland, the
phaeton entered the massive and ornate portals
of Chatsworth House, and crunched the immaculate
gravel, while the lord of all sat with
folded arms and darkened brow, indifferent as a
captive to outer grandeur.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here we are! Come in Harold, old man,”
he said, as the wheels almost grazed the portico.
“By George, I could find it in my heart to sit
down and cry on our own doorstep, but we have
to live and see it out, I suppose. Didn’t you
say you were going to take Laura back? Better
stay and dine. Keep me company, there’s a
good fellow. I’m low enough, God knows!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Harold Stamford would have agreed to this
proposal at once, so touched was he by his old
friend’s woebegone appearance and desponding
words, but he recalled his own engagement. This
he pleaded successfully, adding, “You’ll have the
whole family here on Thursday.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All right, if you can’t, you can’t. Here,
Bateman,” he called out to the coachman who
was driving away from the front, “don’t go
away yet. I want you to take Mr. Stamford
and his daughter home. You may as well go
back to Batty’s in comfort, and this pair doesn’t
get half work enough. They’ll be making a
bolt of it one of these days like Carlo, if I don’t
look out. Ha, ha!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Grandison’s laugh was not pleasant to
hear. His friend followed him into the drawing-room
in silence. Here sat the three ladies,
who were apparently not in bad spirits. Mrs.
Grandison had chased from her brow the marks
of care which were so apparent at an earlier
period of the day, and was joining, apparently
without effort, in the vivacious discourse of the
two young ladies. Miss Josie had contrived to
arise and apparel herself after the fashion of the
period, and though showing some of the pallor
produced by a round of gaiety in a semi-tropical
climate, was on the whole sufficiently attractive.</p>

<p class='c017'>“So this is Laura,” said Mr. Grandison, as he
advanced and warmly greeted the young lady in
question. “Why, what a woman you’ve grown,
and a handsome one, too, or I mistake much.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Why, Josie, we must send you up to the banks
of the Warra Warra, or wherever Windāhgil
is. Near Mooramah, isn’t it, Stamford? ’Pon
my soul! I forget where my own stations are
sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You won’t catch me going into the bush,
father!” said Miss Josie, in a rather sharp tone
of voice. “That is, not farther than North
Shore. It certainly agrees with some people,
and Laura here might play the part of Patience
without dressing. But Sydney is my home, and
I don’t mean to stir from it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s the worst day’s work I ever did in my
life when I brought you all to live here,” said
her father. “I wish to heaven we had continued
to live at the old bush cottage you were
born in, my lady.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t see what difference that would have
made, Robert,” said his wife.</p>

<p class='c017'>“But I do,” said the master of the house.
“You and your children would never have
learned the habits of fashionable folly and
reckless extravagance in which your lives are
spent. We might have been satisfied with a
more natural existence—aye, and, a happier
life.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you only come home early to say disagreeable
things, my dear Robert, I must say
that I like the old way best,” said Mrs. Grandison
with dignity.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I would say a great many more things of
the same sort,” replied he, “if I could persuade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>myself that they would do any good. But it is
too late now. We have sown the wind and
must reap the whirlwind.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This form of discussion tended to render
things generally rather uncomfortable. It would
have been difficult to direct the conversation
into a more conventional channel had not Mr.
Grandison abruptly left the room.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can’t think what has put Robert out so this
afternoon,” said his wife, “of course he keeps
worrying himself about that dreadful affair of
Carlo’s—wicked boy! He told you about that,
Mr. Stamford, I know. I’ve cried my eyes out, and
I shall never be the same woman again, I know.
But what is the use of making your life one long
misery for the sake of a selfish, disobedient son?
He never considered us, I firmly believe, since
he was a boy at school. Then why, as Josie
says, should we consider him? I am not going
to grieve over him any longer. He has chosen
his path.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He’s a selfish, stupid, unprincipled fellow,”
said Josie, with an air of cold decision. “He
has done everything he could to disgrace himself
and us. I am not going to spoil my life on his
account, and I shall never mention his name, or
that of the servant-girl he has chosen to bring
into the family.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think you are too hard; I do indeed,
Josie!” said her mother, “though he deserves
very little at our hands. You are not his mother,
my dear, and you don’t know how it feels. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>I can’t think we should deny ourselves anything
in society for his sake. Just at the beginning
of the gay season in Sydney, too!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Laura, who had looked extremely grave
throughout the discussion, now felt inclined to
smile at Mrs. Grandison’s distressful <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>finale</em></span>. She
rose, and looked at her father to explain the
absolute necessity for their departure.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We shall see you all here at dinner on Thursday,
then, mind that!” said their hostess. “And,
Laura, put on your best bib and tucker. I’ll
have some of our show young men to meet
you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m sure I don’t know where you’ll find
them, mother,” said Josie, disdainfully. “Since
the Lorenzo went to Fiji, there hasn’t been
a man in Sydney fit to look at.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The coachman’s temper was not improved by
the length of time during which he had been
kept waiting. One of the highly-conditioned,
irregularly-exercised horses had indeed revenged
himself by pawing and scraping, the result of
which was a hole in the gravel, which caused the
head gardener to use a much stronger expression
when he saw it than, still mindful of kirk and
minister, he was in the habit of employing.</p>

<p class='c017'>As they went spinning down the incline to
Double Bay, in the easy, well-hung carriage, her
father said, “Wouldn’t you like to have a drag
like this, my dear, to put your husband down at
his office in if you were married and lived in
Sydney?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>“That means if I were somebody else altogether,”
replied Laura, with a slight blush. “I
can’t say how I might act then. But if you ask
me whether I would change places with the poor
people in the splendid house we have just left,
I say, with the country mouse, ‘Give me my
hollow tree and liberty,’ or rather our love and
affection for each other. I don’t think anything
could happen to alter that; do you, father?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford answered by a quick, decided
movement rather than by words. It is to be
hoped no one in that fashionable suburb observed
the action; but even if so, the faultlessly aristocratic
appearance of the equipage in which the
offenders sat would have sufficed to condone the
offence.</p>

<p class='c017'>A comparatively short time saw them at Hyde
Park—too short, indeed, it seemed to Laura,
eager to enjoy the varied beauty of the scene.
The splendours of the dying day, the roll of the
surge upon the outer shore, the rising ocean
breeze, all these seemed to the keen and cultured
sense of the enthusiastic maiden but portions
of a wondrous panorama, of which each hour
furnished a fresh presentment.</p>

<p class='c017'>Linda, from the balcony, beheld them arrive
in state, and waved her handkerchief in token of
welcome and approval. “Oh! Laura, I was
beginning to think you were never coming.
What kept you so late? You will hardly have
time to dress for dinner, and I do so want you
to look well.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>“Why should you want me to look well? I
fancied I was looking rather nice—that is, for a
country cousin, as Josie says.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What!” almost shouted Linda; “hasn’t
father told you? I see he hasn’t—isn’t it just
like him? If the Duke of Edinburgh and Lord
Wolseley were coming to dinner he’d forget
all about it. And yet he thinks he’s a good
father.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“So he is,” said Laura, “and I won’t have
him run down. What is the dreadful secret?
Has the aide-de-camp come to ask us to dinner
at Government House?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No! But without joking, Laura, it is a
matter of importance. That is—we should
have thought so at Windāhgil. Mr. Barrington
Hope is coming to dine.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Is he?” said Laura, coolly. Linda afterwards
said it was “unnatural calmness.” “Then
suppose you ask the maid to turn on the gas
directly. We must put on our best bibs and
tuckers, as Mrs. Grandison says.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Barrington Hope arrived in due time,
accurately apparelled and looking—as most men
do—to great advantage in evening costume.
Though much above the ordinary height, his
breadth of shoulder and justness of proportion
prevented any appearance of incongruity.
Evidently one of those persons who wisely
dismiss the problems of the day with their
ordinary garb, his features wore an entirely
different expression, so closely allied to careless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>ease that Mr. Stamford could hardly believe he
saw before him the anxious brain-worker of the
morning.</p>

<p class='c017'>As the two men stood together on the
balcony overlooking the bay with its evening
crowd of water-wayfarers and pleasure seekers,
the elder said—</p>

<p class='c017'>“How wonderful an image of rest and peace
a calm sea presents, especially at this hour!
There are hard work and deep thoughts frequently
upon blue water, but I confess I can
never connect them together.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“My own feeling, quite,” said Hope. “I
am passionately fond of the sea, but few people
have less time for indulging such a taste. I
always feel it to be the true home of the lotus-eater.
‘In calm or storm, by rock or bay,’
there is rest for the soul when on the deep. If
I were safely embarked for Europe and clear of
the Heads, I should almost expire of joy, I
really believe.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But why do you not take a holiday—a run
to Fiji, San Francisco, Galle, anywhere? All
places strange and foreign are equally good for
change.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Or to the moon,” laughed the young man.
“Nearly as much chance of getting to one as
the other. However, I will think it over and
arrange.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Depend upon it, you should not delay. I
am something of a physiognomist, and I see
reasons for a foreign tour. Why not make an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>application? Urgent private affairs. They
could not be more truthfully described. But
here come my young people.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Stamford and her daughters now appeared.
With her usual prompt kindness she
advanced, upon hearing her husband commence
a formal introduction, and held out her hand to
the young man.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are well known to us by name, Mr.
Hope! I have great pleasure, believe me, in
making your acquaintance. I trust some day
that we may be able to see you at Windāhgil.
You will be indeed welcome to our country
home.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Hope bowed with an air as if disclaiming
all title to unusual indulgence, but his eyes
strayed from the kind face of the speaker to
that of Laura Stamford, to whom, with Linda,
he was now presented.</p>

<p class='c017'>Both these young ladies, in spite of an air of
calm repose, were inwardly somewhat agitated
at beholding a personage in whose favour they
had heard so much. Prone, like most damsels
of the romantic age, to invest the probable
hero with striking attributes, they had yet fallen
short of a correct estimate of Barrington Hope’s
appearance. Connecting him in more or less
degree with his mercantile profession, they had
expected perhaps a look of greater age, a more
concentrated regard, or care-encumbered countenance.
When therefore they were confronted
by one of the best-looking, best-dressed men in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>the metropolis, separated as to air and manner
apparently from any commonplace pecuniary
labours, they could hardly believe their eyes.</p>

<p class='c017'>Linda was inwardly gnashing her teeth, and
reproaching the author of her being in that he
was such an inefficient hand at description.
“Would not any one have imagined, Laura,”
she said afterwards, “that Mr. Hope was a
hard-headed sort of person, clever at figures
and all that, and good to us? And now, quite
suddenly we are brought face to face with a
magnificent man—the finest man I ever saw in
my life. Isn’t it a shame—a crying shame,
Laura?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Isn’t what a crying shame? That Mr. Hope
is asked to dine, or that we couldn’t write and
request his photograph before the original burst
upon us in all his glory? Do you think you
would have liked to behave differently?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am sure I can’t tell. But it was such a
surprise. I might have fainted and disgraced
myself. But you are such a cold-blooded creature,
Laura; I sometimes think you have no
heart.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“H’m,” said Laura, “that is a matter of
opinion. I do not profess to wear my heart
upon my sleeve, but there is an article of the
kind somewhere deep down, I daresay. What
do I think about Mr. Hope? I think him
very nice. He is well-informed, though he
did not parade his knowledge. Understands
the science of music, and plays with taste. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>don’t know that I can say more about him at
present.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a prosaic list of qualities; it might
have been read out of a book! But didn’t you
like him a great deal?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How could I like any one a great deal the
first day I met him? Do you think I resemble
Miss Morton’s heroines, who meet a perfectly
unknown young man, and in an hour have told
him all their family affairs and inmost thoughts?
That kind of transparent simplicity is not in
my line.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But you do like him, Laura. Say you do
really.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of course I like a handsome, agreeable man
who has been of the greatest use and benefit to
the family, as I like any pleasant acquaintance.
Further than that I decline to commit myself.
And now let me go to sleep.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“How you can go to sleep entirely astonishes
me. Oh! wasn’t it a delightful dinner? I felt
so nice. I am sure I looked the essence of propriety
and countrified inexperience. Do you
think he could discover that we had seen very
little society, Laura?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If he was not a very unobservant man he
might easily have made out so much, I should
say; that is if he troubled himself to study us
so deeply. What can it matter?”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was not only on that memorable evening
that Barrington Hope produced a favourable
impression upon the youthful portion of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>Stamford family. Mrs. Stamford was charmed
with him. His manner was so easy, yet so
deferential and so respectful to her and her
daughters. Well-informed as to the European
politics of the day, he inferentially, in an argument
with Mr. Stamford, showed himself to be
widely read. He was familiar with the latest
songs, the very last waltz; he sang a duet with
Laura, and even played an accompaniment
which showed more than theoretical knowledge
of the science of music.</p>

<p class='c017'>When he made his adieux somewhat early in
the evening, every voice was musical in his
praise.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He’s a delightful creature,” said Linda,
“all my fancy painted him, and more. How
different he is from most of the men one meets.
So free from conceit, and yet he knows so much,
doesn’t he? And what a good touch he has on
the piano! But men always play better than
we do when they play at all. When are we
going to see him again?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is to send us tickets for the Bachelors’
Ball,” said Laura. “We shall meet him there,
of course. What a grand affair it is to be!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall catch a fever and die before the day
arrives,” said Linda, plaintively. “The happiness
will be too great to be realised. Oh! oh,
dear! Oh! dear! how shall we pass the intervening
days? Luckily our dresses will take up
a good deal of our thoughts and spare time. Do
you think he dances well, Laura?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>“Mr. Hope appears to do many things well.
I don’t suppose he showed us all his good qualities
in one evening. He is a man of the world,
and doesn’t have all his goods in the shop
window at once.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a horrid idea, Laura. You haven’t
half as much sentiment as I have. I hope he
hasn’t many more accomplishments; I don’t
care for a man being perfect. Perhaps he has a
bad temper underneath. Men with soft voices
often have.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I didn’t notice any uncommon softness of
voice. I thought he spoke naturally, which is
the great thing after all, with men or women
either. But after we go to the ball you will
most likely discover that there are other men in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t care. I am quite certain there are
very few nicer ones, if any. I think you must
admire him yourself, Laura; you are so guarded
about him, and I am sure he has taken a fancy
to you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nonsense, Linda! Really you are old
enough to talk more sensibly. How can any
one form any liking or otherwise in a single
evening?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What, not love at first sight?” exclaimed
Linda, jumping up in an excited manner. “Do
you disbelieve wholly in that? What does
Disraeli say in that lovely <cite>Venetia</cite> of his?
‘There is no love but love at first sight,’ or first
love, I forget which.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“They are different things,” answered Laura;
“but Disraeli ought to have more sense than to
write in a way to turn silly girls’ heads. I
think your novel-reading will have to be restricted,
Linda, before long; I must really
speak to mother.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s too late now, Laura. I’ve read all sorts
of things, but they don’t do girls any harm.
Bad companions do, if you like. They are
destructive; but we never had any friends that
we were ashamed of. And so you don’t like
Mr. Hope.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I didn’t say that,” answered Laura; “but
really you’re as persistent as an interviewer,
Linda,” and she quitted the room.</p>

<p class='c017'>In spite of Linda’s repeated assertions that the
week preceding the ball never would come to an
end, the despised days passed away—perhaps too
quickly indeed for some people. A picnic in
the harbour, the detail of which was arranged
by Mr. Hope, and which every one enjoyed
ecstatically, as Linda avowed, perhaps aided the
flight of time. A visit to the theatre, where
the London Comedy Company was performing,
also tended to prevent undue concentration of
thought. And, oh! wonder of wonders, and
joy of joys, was not the Intercolonial Exhibition,
that Aladdin’s Palace of Art and Industry, daily
open, daily enjoyed to the very acme of novel
excitement?</p>

<p class='c017'>How delicious was it to stroll around the
fountain in the afternoon of each day, while the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>music of the Austrian Band rose to the lofty
roof or floated dreamlike amid the aisles and
courts; to sit silently absorbing delicious sounds
amid the strange beauty and variety of the
scene; to wander amid the heaped up riches of
the curiosities of every land under the sun,
encountering well-known friends unexpectedly,
or exchanging the pleasantries of the hour with
gay acquaintances. Such were the resources
thrown open to the erstwhile dwellers at Windāhgil.
Small surprise need therefore be aroused
by Linda’s next declaration, that the ball would
be upon them all too swiftly, and find them
unprepared. Strangely sweet sorrows and sighs
of youth! joys in disguise are they for the most
part.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Although the ball bore the name of the
Bachelors’, it was generally known to be an
entertainment got up by the unmarried members
of the leading clubs. As was their wont, no
expense would be spared. Invitations had been
comparatively restricted; many had been disappointed
who had made certain of the privilege.
All this, of course, made the happy possessors
of the tickets still more gratified by their good
fortune. The finest hall in the city had been
secured for the occasion. The ornamentation
was said to be unparalleled, the supper without
precedent for style and expensiveness. A celebrated
European band, then on a tour through
Australia, had been engaged. Sailors from a
man-of-war anchored in the harbour were kindly
lent to hold a rope which served to divide the
ball-room. It was questionable whether so truly
magnificent a ball had ever been given in Sydney,
or perhaps would be given again.</p>

<p class='c017'>The weather was evidently “set fair”—there
would be no deduction from comfort on that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>account. It was weeks since a great society
entertainment had been given. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>haute volée</em></span>
of Sydney was manifestly fluttered. Some of
the younger feminine members openly stated
that, after tasting to the full of its delights, they
would be ready to lie down and die.</p>

<p class='c017'>At length the long-expected day arrived, on
the night of which the fondly-anticipated
Bachelors’ Ball was to take place. All feminine
adult Sydney—that is to say, the fortunate
section which was entitled to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>entrée</em></span>—was
moved to its centre. No statistics are to hand
of the number of dressmakers who temporarily
became of unsound mind because of the terrific
call upon their fingers and brains, tempers and
tongues. Nevertheless, according to the doctrine
of averages, there must have been a certain
number of the managers and of the young
persons whose passage to an early grave was
thereby accelerated.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Stamford, wisely forecasting, had carried
out arrangements for her own and the girls’
dresses at a comparatively early period, had got
them home with all necessary alterations and
trimmings decided upon long before the real
crush of the thoughtless began, or the panic of
the dangerously late set in.</p>

<p class='c017'>Simple as were the materials, few the ornaments,
and unobtrusive the accordance with the
prevailing fashion, the full measure of satisfactory
fitting was not completed without
several interviews and divers alterations. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>sum total of her milliner’s bill astonished, even
alarmed, Mrs. Stamford.</p>

<p class='c017'>But her husband, when giving her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>carte
blanche</em></span>, had intimated that he did not wish
trifling economies to be studied, that his wife
and daughters must look their best; all the
world was to be there, and as it was to be a
rare occasion, they had better take full advantage
of it.</p>

<p class='c017'>When the hour sounded, Laura had been
dressed and finished to the last lace; had indeed
been sitting quietly reading, awaiting the arrival
of their carriage. But Linda could not contain
her impatience. She walked up and down the
sitting-room spreading out her dress occasionally,
and requesting her mother to say if it was
“straight,” whether her flowers were exactly in
their places, whether it would not have been
better for her to have worn another colour.
This conversation was varied by wondering
whether she would get any partners, or have to
sit on a seat the whole evening; whether Mr.
Hope would find them out, or be so occupied
with his duties as steward that he would not
observe them or have time to dance with them.
To which inquiries her parents either were
unable to reply satisfactorily or said she would
see when she got there.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you know, Laura,” she suddenly added,
“impartially speaking, you are really a pretty
girl! I am sure if I were a stranger I should
think so; I should indeed. Your features are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>not perfection, except your eyes, I mean—I
don’t think any one could say they were not
first class. But you have a very taking look
when you are interested about anything; and
then you are tallish and slight—not too tall
either. You could look dignified too, if you
liked, which is a great advantage to a woman,
while I am afraid I never could. If I were to
set my mouth and knit my brows and say ‘Sir!
I fail to understand you,’ people would only
laugh and pat me on the back. It would never
freeze the blood in their veins, or anything of
that sort. Now ‘father, dearest father!’ as the
Wanderer in the play says, don’t you think
Laura looks perfectly splendid to-night?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Bless her heart!” said Mr. Stamford,
answering the question while he gazed at his
eldest daughter with fond admiration, “she
looks like a—like a queen in a book, like a
princess in the <cite>Arabian Nights</cite>; like her father’s
own dear girl. I trust she will enjoy herself as
much as she deserves; and you too, Linda,
darling.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Laura Stamford without doubt did look a
most perfect incarnation of innocent, girlish
beauty. And, indeed, when is a maiden more
likely to present that appearance than on the
night of the first ball of note and importance
to which she has been bidden? Her cheek
slightly flushed with the excitement of untasted
pleasure, her eyes sparkling with innocent excitement;
her red-rose lips; her rounded arms;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>her ivory neck; her slender, supple form; her
free, elastic step—if these attributes do not, in
combination, make up the wondrous, God-given,
crowning gift of beauty, then have the grateful
eyes of mankind never been gladdened with the
vision.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Father is perfectly just in his opinion of
dear Laura’s appearance to-night,” said Mrs.
Stamford, with a mother’s guarded approval;
“and my little girl here, too, looks extremely
nice. I might say more, were I not afraid of
making her vain. I can only tell her not to be
anxious about herself; to trust to the course of
events, and all will go well. We must have a
grand talk over it all to-morrow morning.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Here comes the carriage at last, I am thankful
to say,” said Laura, as the grand London-made
barouche rolled up to the door, while the
footman rang the bell sufficiently long to make
a nervous inmate conclude it to be a fire.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Muffle up and run down, my dears! We
must not keep three hundred guineas’ worth of
horseflesh waiting at night,” said her father.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Grandison and Josie were in the carriage.
The former made room beside her for Mrs.
Stamford, saying, “You girls must sit together
on the back seat. It’s large enough to hold
four of you now there’s no crinoline—at least,
none to speak of. Perhaps Mr. Stamford
won’t mind sitting on the box—once upon a
time two people would have filled this carriage.
How did you get on with your dresses, girls?
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>Mine and Josie’s only came late in the afternoon,
after that infamous Madame Rocheretti
promising to have them fitted on and everything
done in the way of trimmings yesterday.
However, she threw herself on my mercy, as
she said the Government House people had
come down upon her at the last moment.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t believe a word of it,” said Josie.
“However, I have made up my mind to have
my dresses made at Justine’s in future. She is
dearer, but she has twice as much originality.
What have you got on, Laura?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nothing very wonderful. We went to
mother’s old dressmaker, Madame Schlesinger,
that she used to have when she was first
married. She is behind the times, I dare say,
but a ball is a ball with Linda and me. We
shall enjoy ourselves, I dare say. If we are
much disfigured this time, we shall gradually
advance to a knowledge of high millinery.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’ll see when you go into the room how
the other women are dressed,” said Josie
authoritatively. “If you’re dowdy, it will make
you so miserable that you’ll be more careful
next time. I would have come down and given
you a hint or two, but I make it a rule never to
stir out on the day of a ball, and all yesterday I
was too busy.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is very kind of you,” said Laura, warmly,
“and we were uncertain about several things,
but it doesn’t matter particularly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Laura must make up by freshness and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>youth what she wants in style,” said Mrs.
Grandison good-humouredly. “I dare say she
and Linda will do very well, though I really
believe Josie’s will be the best dress in the room.
And indeed it ought to be. Mr. Grandison’s
cheque, and it was a large one, didn’t nearly
pay for it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Laura is only a year younger than I am,
mamma,” said Josie, rather sharply. “One
would think I was getting quite an old hag. I
wonder if all the best men are going? Is that
good looking Mr. Hope sure to be there?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” said Linda; “he told us he was one
of the committee.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Further conversation was rendered difficult
by the dashing of the carriage into the “line.”
The string of ball-ward carriages, of which they
now formed a part, compelled them to proceed
at a walk until the foremost vehicles drove up
and deposited their occupants. The novelty of
making a part of such an astonishing procession
almost roused Linda’s spirits to the point of
expressing the admiration of everything which
she felt. But, recalling her mother’s advice
and the responsibility of decorous demeanour
now cast upon her, she refrained, at great
personal cost and self-denial. She was rewarded
in turn by the arrival of the carriage at the
magic portal, from the interior of which a blaze
of lamps and fairy splendour was visible.</p>

<p class='c017'>A few moments saw them safely ushered into
the dressing-room, provided with all accessories
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>needful for repairing temporary damage or
partial disarray. Small stay, however, was made
here, and after Josie had gazed at herself in the
mirrors from every conceivable point, and had
herself adjusted by her obedient mother in
several different modes, they bent their steps
towards the main entrance to the ball-room,
where they found Mr. Stamford awaiting them.
By a curious coincidence, Mr. Barrington Hope
chanced to come that way, when, giving his arm
to Mrs. Stamford and Laura, he walked up to
the top of the enormous room, leaving Mr.
Stamford to bring up the rear with Mrs.
Grandison and the two girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>The latter lady lost no time in locating
herself next to the wife of a well-known
member of Parliament, and at no great distance
from the wife and daughter of the
Governor.</p>

<p class='c017'>She signed to Mrs. Stamford to sit next to
her, and being thus within the Vice-regal circle,
as it were, considered the seating and rendezvous
part of the business to be settled for the night.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Barrington Hope immediately possessed
himself of Laura’s card, upon which he inscribed
his name for two waltzes and said
something about an extra as well. Josie was
surrounded by several of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>jeunesse dorée</em></span>, who
appropriated a large share of the dances not
marked engaged. Of these there were several
unnamed, and yet not open. When questioned,
she declined to give the names of her partners,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>merely remarking that she reserved them for
friends. As for Linda, she sat down in a state
of wonder and admiration at the whole splendid
array, to her astonished gaze supernal in glory
and dazzling in brilliancy. The magnificent and
lofty hall, the crowd of well-dressed men and
women, the glass-like floor, the melodious crash
of the band, which filled the room with the
music of the spheres, as it seemed to her, the
hall divided by a rope held by picturesque tars
modelled upon the lines of the nautical melodrama;
the swing and sway of the immortal
dance-music of Johann Strauss—which had for
some time commenced—the uniforms of the
naval and military officers, all these wonders
and splendours for a time obscured in her
mind the fact that nobody had as yet asked
her to dance.</p>

<p class='c017'>She had suddenly become aware of this
fact, and was subsiding into a plaintive and
resigned condition, a prey to dismal anticipations,
when Mr. Hope suddenly appeared in
company of a naval lieutenant, whom he begged
leave to introduce.</p>

<p class='c017'>Linda bowed with acquiescence, and the next
moment was whirling around with the joyous
throng, conscious that she danced well, feeling
herself to be one of the leading performers, and
quite on a par with all other individuals of her
age and sex.</p>

<p class='c017'>The young officer danced well, as do naval
men generally. He talked easily and agreeably,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>with that happy mixture of brusquerie and
refinement which renders the service so irresistible.
Linda apparently came up to his
standard of a nice girl and a desirable partner,
since he begged leave to put down his name for
two more dances; he also brought up some
brother officers, including a stout doctor and a
small but preternaturally cool and amusing midshipman,
so that when Mr. Hope came for
his dance, he was nearly crowded out by the
naval brigade, who quite encompassed Linda,
to the exclusion of the most irreproachable
civilians.</p>

<p class='c017'>If Linda was a success, it seemed that Laura
was destined to achieve a genuine triumph.</p>

<p class='c017'>Shortly after her first dance with Barrington
Hope there appeared to be an unusual amount
of interest displayed in the vicinity of Mrs.
Grandison, who, of course, was extensively
known in the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>grande monde</em></span>. A variety of
entertaining conversation was indulged in with
that lady, generally ending with a respectful
request for an introduction to the young lady in
white.</p>

<p class='c017'>The good-natured matron did not grudge the
girl her meed of praise; still she occasionally
remarked without satisfaction that the great
guns of the fashionable world, the inheritors of
wealth and estates of proverbial grandeur, the
travelled and fastidious “elegants,” contented
themselves with a passing notice or a laughing
exchange of badinage with Josie while they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>struggled for Laura’s card, and searched closely
the lower figures of the programme, uncertain as
she declared it to be that her party would
remain to conclude it.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Grandison, who had stayed rather late at
the club over a seductive hand of whist, now
came up in time to glance at things generally.
He was extremely complimentary as to the
appearance of his young friends, and declared
that Laura had been voted the belle of the ball
by several of the leading authorities of the club,
against whose decision there was manifestly no
appeal.</p>

<p class='c017'>“There’s a sort of freshness, and, well, I
hardly know what to call it,” he said, “about
girls that come from the country that fetches
the men of taste. The town girls are better
millinered and so on; but they can’t get the
colour and the innocent look, the—ah—dew-drop,
early morning sort of brightness,” continued
Mr. Grandison, who had refreshed liberally
with the Heidsiek dry monopole which the
club imported, and was becoming poetical.
“That’s what there’s no standing against.
Dash it, Stamford, old fellow! Laura’s cut
’em all down to-night. White dress, rose in
her hair, and so on. It’s the real thing when
the complexion will stand it. There’s not a
girl here to-night who’s a patch on her. I
heard Donald M’Intosh say so himself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This stupendous announcement produced no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>reply for the moment. That <em>the</em> bachelor
eligible, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>par excellence</em></span>, the man of estates and
establishments, who had travelled, had taken an
English University degree, distinguished equally
for tennis play as for parliamentary influence,
who was generally an invited member of the
Vice-regal party at public demonstrations and
amusements, that <em>he</em> should have awarded
the golden pippin to the unknown provincial
damsel, struck Mrs. Grandison dumb with
astonishment, and caused Josie to turn paler
with envy than even her ordinary complexion
warranted.</p>

<p class='c017'>When Mrs. Grandison recovered herself, she
said, “Upon my word, Mr. Grandison, you’re
determined to make the girl vain—though
she is dancing now, and can’t hear. One would
think you hadn’t a daughter of your own. Not
but what Laura does look very nice, Mrs. Stamford,
only it seems to me the champagne’s very
good to-night.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What do people come to a ball for?”
returned her husband, gallantly. “Come over
to the supper-table and have a glass yourself,
my dear. Stamford, you bring my wife and
Josie. I’ll take Mrs. Stamford, and we’ll drink
Laura’s health. After that it’s time to go
home. Struck two, and the best of the fun’s
over.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ve had enough,” said Josie, who had sat
out the last two dances. “For my part, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>begin to hate balls; they get stupider every
time, I think. And, oh, how tired I am!”</p>

<p class='c017'>So in ten minutes afterwards, Mr. Stamford
and his wife marched down the room and carried
off their daughters, to the great and sincere
grief of their prospective partners.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Laura Stamford, like other girls, would
have preferred to stay at the ball for
another hour—to have danced another waltz
with Mr. Donald M’Intosh, who indeed made
himself most agreeable. But her natural tendencies
lay in the direction of sympathetic
consideration for others. When, therefore, she
remarked the tired look on her mother’s face,
and, moreover, instantly remembered that they
were to be conveyed homeward in the
Grandisons’ carriage, she at once declared her
willingness to depart, telling her despairing
partner that “she must really go; Mrs.
Grandison and her mother were waiting for
her.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If I persuade Mrs. Grandison to wait for
the next waltz, may I say I have your permission?”
eagerly inquired Mr. M’Intosh.</p>

<p class='c017'>“No! indeed, no!” said Laura, looking at
Mrs. Stamford’s resigned yet weary countenance,
the lines on which she could read so
well. “No, thank you! I must say good bye,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>I really must not consent to stay on any terms
whatever. Please to take me to my mother.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. M’Intosh bowed low, and made his most
impressive adieu. After which he betook himself
to the supper-room, and declined dancing
for the short time for which he remained among
the revellers.</p>

<p class='c017'>Latish, but not unreasonably near to lunchtime,
the Stamford family showed up to breakfast
after the ball.</p>

<p class='c017'>Every one was tolerably fresh. The slight
pallor, the darkened lines under the eyes of
Laura and Linda, only communicated an added
charm to their youthful countenances.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Stamford looked hardly restored, but
after the first cup of tea rallied, and enjoyed a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>réchauffé</em></span> of the great night’s entertainment.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Whatever happens, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de"><em>Ich habe gelebt und
geliebt</em></span>,” said Linda, who had a turn for German
literature. “I did not believe such happiness
was to be found on earth! And to think that
I am only nineteen, too! I shall die early, or
else it will consume me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You certainly seemed to be having a very
pleasant time of it, with your naval friends,”
assented Laura. “People’s views of the area
of existence must be enlarging. But it certainly
was the most transcendent ball. I feel
almost humiliated at having enjoyed it so
much.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I begin to think we must not have many
dances of that sort,” said Mrs. Stamford. “I’m
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>afraid they are too exciting. You girls will find
Windāhgil dull and prosaic after this.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not at all,” said Laura, taking her mother’s
hand affectionately. “We shall have souvenirs
that will last us a year, that is all. Next to
coming to town the going back to dear, peaceful,
happy old Windāhgil is the greatest pleasure I
can imagine in life.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Won’t it be delightful,” said Linda,
“talking over all our experiences? Then reading
up the lovely books we’re taking home. I
always wonder how any one can call “the bush”
dull. It will be a perfect elysium of rest after
all this fierce excitement.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And when are we to go home?” inquired
Mr. Stamford tentatively; “at the end of the
week?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! no, no! out of the question,” called
out both the girls.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Fitzurse said,” pleaded Linda, “that
they were going to have a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>déjeuner</em></span> and a dance
on board the <cite>Eurydice</cite> on Monday, and if I
didn’t go the ship would turn over and sink,
like the <cite>Austral</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. M’Intosh mentioned something about a
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>matinée musicale</em></span> which was to be at Government
House on Tuesday,“ said Laura, at which
Mademoiselle Claironnet was to give her celebrated
recitals out of <cite>Lohengrin</cite>. It would be a
pity to miss that. He felt sure we would have
tickets sent us.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“There’s to be a tennis party at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>Whartons’,” said Linda, “on Wednesday.
They have an asphalte court, and the winners of
the last tournament are to be there, besides Miss
Constance Grey, who is the champion Melbourne
player. I want to see if I have any of my old
form left.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Mr. Hope is going to drive four-in-hand to
the picnic at Botany Heads on Thursday,” said
Laura, carelessly; “he said he could easily take
us all, and I was to have the box seat. It would
be almost a pity not to go, don’t you think?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Exactly so,” said Mr. Stamford; “and
we’re all to dine at Chatsworth on Friday, so it
looks as if the week was pretty well discounted
in advance. Well, Saturday for recovery, on
Sunday we’ll all go to the Cathedral, on
Monday—mind, Monday week—we start for
home, if all the picnics, parties, and pleasure-promises
of Sydney were to be left unfurnished
and unfulfilled.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am sure, girls, you should think your
father the best of living parents,” said Mrs.
Stamford. “I don’t know how we can be
grateful enough to him. I wanted a day’s
shopping before our departure, and this will give
us time to finish up comfortably. I was dreadfully
afraid that we should have to leave town
this week.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Laura and Linda laughed outright at this.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why, mother,” said Linda, we couldn’t do
that without breaking our words, being ungrateful,
and doing everything that you have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>brought us up not to do; could we, Laura? I
promised faithfully to go to this dance on board
the <cite>Eurydice</cite>; she’s anchored in Neutral Bay, and
Mr. Fitzurse said he’d send a boat specially for
us. It would be disgraceful to throw him over.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And who gave you leave to promise and
vow, Miss Linda, in the absence of your parents,
may I ask?” said Mr. Stamford. “You don’t
seem to understand that, unless we are consulted,
all your undertakings are vain.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! but I knew you would approve,” said
Linda; “besides Mr. Fitzurse was so respectful
and nice—perfectly timid, in fact—that I thought
it would be unladylike to refuse. And we have
never seen a man-of-war—a ship I mean. What
a lot we shall have to tell Hubert, shall we not,
mother?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If you tell him everything you’ll have a
great historiette, or confession, whatever you
call it, to make,” said Laura, “if one may
judge by the amount of chattering I saw going
on.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Some people may not chatter, but do a
great deal of serious—h’m—friendship-making
in the same time,” retorted Linda. “But I
don’t mind, I’m so happy. Everything’s delightful.
I had no idea the world was such a
nice place.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Although matters could not be expected to
keep up to the degree of high pressure
indicated, an unusual and highly satisfactory
amount of recreation was transacted during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>remainder of the reprieve allowed by fate and
Mr. Stamford.</p>

<p class='c017'>The dance on board the <cite>Eurydice</cite> came off,
when Linda enjoyed the supreme and exquisite
felicity of being taken off from the pier in a
barge with twelve rowers and the <cite>Eurydice</cite> flag
flying; the crew being dominated by an implacable
midshipman of the sternest demeanour.
They were received with all due formality and
ceremony at the gangway, and being thereafter
marshalled about by Lieutenant Fitzurse, before
envious comrades, Linda’s joy was complete.
The dance, as most naval entertainments are,
was wonderfully organised, and truly successful.
Epauletted heroes were plentiful, and even the
Commodore himself graciously explained the
rudiments of nautical science to Laura and her
mother. The happy day ended with a
romantic return sail, with a favouring breeze,
under a silver moon, over the mystical, motionless
deep.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was fairyland once more possible in this
world below. The happy girls could hardly
realise that they were the same people who had
been, but one little year ago, mourning the
unkind season, sadly contending with the wrath
of Heaven and the wrongs of earth.</p>

<p class='c017'>The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>matinée musicale</em></span>, honoured by Vice-regal
patronage, was also transacted with all
the society population of Sydney in full array
and punctual attendance. Here Mr. Donald
M’Intosh, a distinguished amateur, held pre-eminent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>sway. His “marked attentions” to
Laura caused her to be the observed of all
observers, a circumstance which, however, did
not interfere with her frankly expressed enjoyment
of the musical luxuries.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why, Laura!” said her cousin, “if you go
on in this way you and Linda will have all the
Sydney girls mobbing you, or petitioning for
your rustication without delay. You have
fascinated the sailors, and not contented with
that, you seem only to have to hold up your
hand to have that difficult, delightful Mr.
M’Intosh, the least susceptible man in Sydney,
at your feet. Then there is Mr. Hope,
neglecting his business and driving four-in-hand,
as I hear to this picnic, all for your sake!
What is your charm, may I ask?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t quite understand you, Josie,” she
answered (which, perhaps, was pardonably insincere);
“we are enjoying ourselves very
much, and everybody is extremely kind.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should think so, indeed,” replied Miss
Josie, scornfully.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for the great picnic, everybody was there.
The day was lovely, the sea calm, the sky of the
glowing azure which the south land only boasts,
the road perfect. The rival four-in-hand drags,
including Mr. Hope’s chestnuts, combined to
produce a perfectly faithful presentment of the
ideal life which Linda had previously concluded
to be limited to society novels, and the, perhaps,
mythical personages depicted therein.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>There was even a Royal Duke among the
guests, though when he was pointed out to her,
Laura committed the error of mistaking for him
a well-known officer of police in attendance,
whose aristocratic figure and distinguished bearing
at once decided her in her quest for royalty.
However, the slight mistake was soon rectified,
and the day burned itself into her maiden
consciousness as one of those seasons of enjoyment
which rarely fulfil anticipation, but if so,
continue to illumine the halls of memory until
life’s latest hour.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is our farewell to the sea for a while,”
thought Laura. “I can’t help feeling melancholy.
What a lovely haze spreads over the
ocean in the distance! How strange to think
that it is nearly a hundred years since Cook
sailed into these silent headlands. What a new
world he was preparing! It was more than a
discovery. Almost a creation. Oh, day of
days! Oh, whispering breeze! Oh, soft blue
sky! Can the earth hold anything more
lovely?”</p>

<p class='c017'>The “pleasures and palaces” having come to
an end, the fatal Monday made its unwelcome
appearance.</p>

<p class='c017'>As the Stamfords’ day of departure was
known, there was an unwonted influx of afternoon
visitors at their rooms, besides a dropping
fire of cards, notes, and messages, expressive of
different shades of regret.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, dear! I had no idea Sydney was such a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>nice place,” exclaimed Linda, as the twilight
hour approached, and the stream of friends and
acquaintances ceased to flow. “I could not
have believed there were so many delightful
people in the world. Why will writers say so
many unpleasant things about society? It seems
full of polite, graceful, affectionate persons. As
for the malignant and wicked people that all the
books rave about, where are they? We have
not seen them, certainly, or even heard of them,
have we, Laura?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I believe not—yes—no,” answered Laura,
absently. “But who said anybody was wicked?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nobody, of course,” explained Linda. “I
only meant that in every book you read there
are pages and pages devoted to descriptions of
ingeniously wicked people, who seem as common
in every city as bookmakers at a racecourse,
whereas I said we never see any of them, or hear
either.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“See whom?” inquired Laura, who was looking
out thoughtfully over the harbour. “Do
you mean any one who called this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What nonsense you are talking, Laura! I
really believe you must be thinking of something,
or rather somebody, else. I wonder whom
it can be? Certainly you have received a good
deal of attention—‘marked attention,’ as Mrs.
Grandison always says. How cross Josie looked
when she said it! First of all Mr. Barrington
Hope, then Mr. M’Intosh, then Mr.—who was
that nice man from New Zealand?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>“Really Linda, you are altogether too
ridiculous. Am I to be called to account about
every one of my partners? If so, you had
better get my ball programmes—I have kept
them all—and ask everybody’s intentions right
down the lists.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t mean partners, Laura; I had plenty
of them, I am thankful to say; but people
didn’t come every other day to the house—besides
waylaying one everywhere, and making a
fuss over father and poor dear mother. They
drew the line at that.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel more and more convinced, Linda, that
you have not quite finished packing,” remarked
Laura calmly. “The tea-bell will ring directly,
and we shall have no more time then. Do think
a little. I saw your cerise silk in our room, I
feel sure, just now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, my lovely cerise silk! To think I
should have forgotten it!” said Linda, quite
diverted from her line of cross-questioning.
“But where will it go? I haven’t the faintest
notion. My trunk is full—more than full—and
pressed down. It wouldn’t hold another
handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Be a good girl, and promise to talk sensibly,
and I may spare you a place in mine,” said
Laura, smiling at her victory. “I am just
going to fold and put away my last
dress.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You are always so kind, Laura. I did not
mean to tease you, but I really do feel anxious
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>about Mr. M’Intosh. Suppose he was only
amusing himself with you all the time!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then you will be able to console yourself
with the idea that you have seen at least one
wicked person,” said Laura, with great good
humour; “and so your knowledge of the great
world will be expanded. But I will venture to
contradict the charge, as far as he is concerned.
But remember on what terms I provide a place
for your forlorn dress. Besides I want to write
one or two good-bye notes.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Although Laura was outwardly calm and
self-possessed, she was not wholly unmoved by
certain considerations which Linda’s badinage
had suggested.</p>

<p class='c017'>Unless her perception played her false upon
a subject on which women, even when inexperienced,
commonly judge correctly, both Mr.
Barrington Hope and Mr. M’Intosh were
seriously interested in her good opinion of
them. The latter gentleman had indeed been
so persistent and pressing, that she had been
compelled with great gentleness, yet with
firmness, to discourage his advances. This step
she took with a certain reluctance—more
perhaps, because she had not finally resolved as
to her state of feeling than because she in any
way disliked him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Dislike him? No—who could, indeed, dislike
Donald M’Intosh? Was he not handsome,
accomplished, manly, possessed, moreover, of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>all the subtle graces of manner that almost
invariably attach themselves to a man, be he
good, bad, or indifferent as to morals or brains,
who has “seen the world,” as the phrase runs—who
has met his fellow-creatures all his life
under the highly-favoured circumstances of an
assured position and ample means?</p>

<p class='c017'>He certainly had been most assiduous, most
respectful, most flatteringly <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>empresse</em></span> in his
manner, bestowing that unconcealed admiration
which gratifies the vanity of womanhood, at the
same time that it is apt to arouse the ire of the
virgins, both wise and foolish, who are less
prominently noticed.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then his “position,” as it is called. He
possessed that social distinction, that untitled
rank, which is perhaps as clearly defined, as
freely yielded, or firmly refused, in a colony as
in England. He was a great country gentleman—such
a man as in Britain a hundred years ago
would have periodically gone up to London in
his family carriage attended by outriders and
driven by postillions. Here in the colonies
he was known as a man of good family, who
had inherited large estates, besides pastoral
possessions of even greater value, lands in city
and suburbs, houses in fashionable squares all
derived from well-considered investments in
those early days when every hundred pounds in
cash—sometimes even a tenth of that proverbial
sum—so invested bore fruit fiftyfold or a
thousandfold, as the case might be.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>Then there was his magnificent place,
Glenduart, of which everybody had heard.
Such a drawing-room, such suites of apartments!
Gardens and stables, conservatories and fountains,
picture-gallery and statuary—what not!
Had he not entertained the Governor and Lady
Delmore there? Everybody said it was like a
nobleman’s house in England, or, at any rate,
one of those beautiful old country seats which
are the glory of the parent land. His horses,
too, his carriages—what a four-in-hand team
had he driven at the picnic they had all gone
to!</p>

<p class='c017'>And all this at her feet! Was there a girl
in Sydney—as far as any one could judge—that
would not—she could not say “jump at,” even
in her thoughts—but willingly accept him?</p>

<p class='c017'>What a chorus of congratulations or detractions,
both equally gratifying, would not the
announcement of her engagement arouse!</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus far the world, the natural, impulsive
feeling of the human heart, unchecked by the
calm voice of reason, the warnings of the inner
soul.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the other hand, was he so fitted in
character and mentally fashioned as to accord
with the tone of her mind, with the principles
in which from childhood she had been reared?
Did they agree in opinion on subjects which
were to her vitally important? Were their
tastes mainly in accord? and if differing, was
his disposition such as would lead her to suppose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>that he would modify his predilections to
suit her wishes?</p>

<p class='c017'>She could not say. She did not know. Her
ignorance of his character was complete. All
that she could possibly assure herself that she
knew concerning Donald M’Intosh was what the
world said of him, and no more—that he was
brave, generous, courteous, and rich. So much
she admitted. But her experience had been
merely of the outer husk of his nature. The
varnish with which the natural man is concealed
from his fellows was flawless and brilliant. All
might be in accordance with the fair-seeming,
attractive exterior. On the other hand, much
might be hidden beneath, the revelation of
which would constitute the difference to Laura
Stamford between joy and peace, hope and happiness
upon earth, or misery complete and unending,
hopeless despair.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was a terrible risk to run, an uncertainty
altogether too momentous to encounter
at present. Dismissing the subject
of Mr. M’Intosh’s interests and prospects,
there was—and she blushed even when naming
his name in her own heart—there was Barrington
Hope. He had little to offer in any way
comparable to the other in what most people
would consider the essentials of matrimonial
success. A hard-worked man compelled to tax
his every mental faculty to the uttermost, in
order to meet the demands of his occupation.
From one point of view, no doubt, his position
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>was high; no man of his age had, perhaps, the
same rank and consideration in finance. But
the magnificence of “seigneury” was not his—never
probably would be. In spite of his birth,
which was equal to that of any magnate of the
land, no girl of the period, no matron who knew
the world, would think for a moment of comparing
the social status of the two men.</p>

<p class='c017'>But in his favour there were arguments of
weight. She knew him to be a man of refined
tastes, of literary culture, of high moral
principle, of fastidious delicacy of tone and taste.
It may be that Laura Stamford only thought she
knew these things, that she committed the
feminine mistake of taking for granted that the
hero of her girlish romance was perfection. It
may be confessed here that Barrington Hope
was the first man who had had power to stir
those mysterious passion-currents which sleep
so calmly in the heart of youth, puissant as they
are when fully aroused to hurry the possessor to
destruction or despair. But she was, for her
age, a calm observer, having, moreover, a full
measure of the sex’s intuitive discernment. In
all their light or serious conversation, she had
marked in the mind of Barrington Hope the
signs of high and lofty purpose, of a chivalrous
nature, an inborn generosity only controlled by
the voice of conscience and the dictates of an
enforced prudence.</p>

<p class='c017'>And did he love her as in her heart she told
herself she deserved to be loved?</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Of that all-important fact she could not yet
assure herself. But, patient ever, and modestly
doubtful of all things which concerned her
personal influence, Laura decided that she could
well afford to await the direction of circumstances.
Her home duties were still paramount in her
steadfast mind. She had no immediate wish
that they should be cast aside for objects purely
personal. There was yet much to do at
Windāhgil. Linda was scarcely capable of
assuming the responsibilities of housekeeping,
and should she make default, she knew upon
whose shoulders the burden would fall. The
younger brothers and Hubert, who had hardly
been separated from her thoughts for an hour
since childhood—all the love and gentle tendence
due to them were not to be uprooted and flung
away to wither like weeds out of the garden
path. No! The time might come when she,
Laura Stamford, like other girls, would go forth
from her father’s house, bidding farewell to the
loved ones of her youth—of her life—part of
her very soul, as they were; but there was no
necessity for haste. She must take time for
careful choice—for sober counsel. She had
never been wont to do anything of importance
hastily. She would not furnish so bad a precedent
now.</p>

<p class='c017'>So in spite of Linda’s desponding protestations
that they never would be actually,
completely, and finally packed up, the fated
evening came which witnessed a devoted cab,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>overladen with such an array of luggage as
caused Mr. Stamford to exclaim and the hall-porter
to smile.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the preceding Sunday every one had gone
dutifully to church, but in the afternoon Linda’s
devotional feelings must have been somewhat
intermixed with ideas of a nautical nature,
judging from audible scraps of conversation, as
carried on by Lieutenant Fitzurse, R.N., and
his comrades, who had thought it only decent
and fitting, as they observed, to make their
adieux to Miss Linda Stamford before she went
back to Western Australia or Riverina, or
whatever far-away place “in the bush,” they
had heard she was bound for.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Hope did not arrive on that afternoon,
although Mr. M’Intosh did, but, having something
to say to Mr. Stamford, presumably on
business, he came in time to accompany them to
the railway station, and to receive a warm
invitation from that gentleman to visit them at
Windāhgil directly he could get leave of absence.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Linda began to look out of the window at
least two miles from the Mooramah railway
station. A few seconds before the train stopped,
she discovered Hubert on the platform.</p>

<p class='c017'>Waving his hand to her, he was at the window
in a moment, receiving, indeed, personal tokens
of welcome long before the guard could open
the door and collect the tickets.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! I <em>am</em> so glad to see you again,
dearest, dearest Hubert,” exclaimed Linda.
“You have no idea how nice and large
Mooramah looks. I am sure I shall never
stir away from dear old Windāhgil for a year.
I don’t feel proud at all, do you, Laura? I
am sure we are both immensely improved,
though. Don’t you think so, Hubert?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You must wait till you are at home again,
and I can turn you round and examine you
both carefully,” said Hubert; “there are too
many people here at present. I think mother
looks splendid, and the governor gets younger
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>every time he sees Sydney. I shall have to go
soon, or our ages will be reversed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor, dear old Hubert!” said Laura, looking
at her brother’s sun-burnt face, and spare,
muscular figure; “I’m sure you’ve been working
yourself to death while we were away, with
nobody to stop you. Never mind, we’ll soon
make a difference—if we don’t talk you to
death the first week.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can hear all you’ve got to say,” said Hubert;
“but just now let us get the luggage counted
and ready for Jerry to put in the spring cart;
then we’ll rattle home in the buggy. Don’t
the old horses look well?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Splendid!” said Linda. “They have
beautiful coats too, which I did not expect.
They’re not quite so aristocratic in demeanour
as Mr. Grandison’s carriage horses, but they can
trot about double as fast, I daresay.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They look very different to what they did
this time last year,” said Hubert, running his
eye over the middle-sized, well-bred, wiry pair.
“Do you remember poor old Whalebone tumbling
down—Whipcord was nearly as bad—as
we were driving to church, from sheer weakness?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! yes,” said Linda; “we had to tie up
the pole of the buggy with our pocket-handkerchiefs;
poor old dear! He looks as if he could
pull one’s arms off now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Once fairly off behind the fourteen-mile-an-hour
buggy horses, spinning along the smooth
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>bush road—the best wheel track in the world in
good weather and in a dry country, that is, its
normal state—the spirits of the party rose
several degrees. Mr. Stamford and his wife
were calmly happy at the idea of returning to
their quiet home life, having had enough of the
excitement of city and suburb for a while. The
girls were continually exclaiming, as each new
turn of the road brought them within sight of
well-remembered spots and familiar points of
the landscape, while Hubert, much too happy
to talk, kept looking at his relatives, one by
one, with an air of intense, overflowing affection.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s worth all the loneliness to have you
back again,” he said, patting his mother’s cheek;
“but it was horribly dismal for a time. I felt
as if I could have left the run in charge of the
boundary-riders, only for shame, and run down
to Sydney myself. Fortunately, Laura wrote so
regularly that I seemed to know what you were
doing and saving, as well as almost everything
you thought.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wrote too, I’m sure,” said Linda, with an
injured air.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, you were more spasmodic. Though
I was very glad to get your letters too. I
acquired a deal of information about the
‘Queen’s Navee,’ in which department I was
weak. However, I suppose it’s as well to know
everything.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m sure you are most ungrateful,” pouted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Linda, “If you only knew how hard it is to
write!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, ho! quoting from Lord Sandwich’s
lines:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c021'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘To all you ladies now on land</div>
      <div class='line in2'>We men at sea indite,</div>
      <div class='line'>But first I’d have you understand</div>
      <div class='line in2'>How hard it is to write.’”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'>“You are too clever altogether, Hubert,”
said Linda, with rather a conscious laugh.
“You must have been taking lessons in mind-reading,
or some such stuff, in our absence.
But oh! there are some of the Windāhgil
sheep. How well they look! I’d almost forgotten
there were such dear creatures in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If it were not for them and their fleeces
there would not be any trips to Sydney, or
bachelors’ balls, or picnics,” said Mr. Stamford;
“so keep up a proper respect for the merino
interest, and all belonging to it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They never looked better than they do
now,” said Hubert; “the season has been a
trifle dry since you left, but I think they are
all the better for it. And did not the wool
bring a capital price?” he continued. “I see
you sold it all in Sydney—two and a penny,
and two and threepence for the hogget bales.
The wash-pen was paid for over and over again.
However, I have a plan in my head for getting
it up better still next year.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s right, my boy,” said his father;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>“stick well to your business and it will stick to
you—a homely proverb, but full of wisdom.
How does the garden look?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not so bad. I had it made pretty decent
for mother to look at. I kept all the new
plants watered—they’ve grown splendidly, and
I managed, with a little help, to get up a
‘bush house’ in case mother brought up any
new ferns, or <em>Coleus</em> novelties.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The very thing I am wishing for, my dear
boy,” said his mother. “I was just wondering
how I could manage; I did get a few pot plants
and ferns.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“A few!” said Mr. Stamford, making believe
to frown. “You showed a correct estimate
of your mother’s probable weakness, however,
Hubert. I don’t know that you could have
spent your leisure time more profitably.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Home, sweet home!” sang Linda, as they
drove up to the well-known white gate. “How
lovely the garden looks, and everything about
the dear old place is flourishing; even the
turkeys have grown up since we left. I feel
as if I could go round and kiss everything—the
very posts of the verandah. That is the
advantage of going away. I really think it
is one’s duty to do so; it makes you value your
home so when you come back.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall have no curiosity about the great
world for a year at least,” said Laura. “It
will take us nearly that time to read all the new
books; and to properly enjoy the garden, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>going to have a fernery of my own. I bought
the <cite>Fern World</cite> out of my own money, and
somebody—I forget who it was—promised to
send me some rare New Zealand and South
Sea Island ferns. After all, the pleasures of
country life are the best, I really do believe;
they are so calm and peaceful and yet satisfying.”</p>

<p class='c017'>That first meal, lunch or dinner, as it might
happen to be, in the old familiar room, was an
unmixed delight to all. The two servants,
having just returned, had exerted themselves
to prepare a somewhat <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>recherché</em></span> repast for the
family, to whom they were attached, and whose
return they hailed with honest expressions
of welcome. The cookery and arrangements
generally met with special commendation, while
in the intervals of talking, laughing, and sudden
exclamations of delight, Linda repeated her conviction
that she had never enjoyed eating and
drinking so much since she left Windāhgil.</p>

<p class='c017'>Immediately after this necessary performance,
Hubert and Mr. Stamford betook themselves
to one of the outlying portions of the run,
where the son was anxious for his father to
behold the success of a new dam lately constructed.
This piece of engineering had “thrown
back” the water of a creek nearly two miles,
thus affording permanent sustenance for a large
flock of sheep.</p>

<p class='c017'>“These weaners were formerly obliged to
come in to the frontage, you remember governor,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>where they were always mixing with the other
sheep. The water dried up regularly about
this time. Now they can stay here till next
shearing, and I think the country suits them
better, too.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They are looking uncommonly well,” said
Mr. Stamford, running his eye over a flock of
fine, well-grown young sheep, which were just
moving out to grass after their noonday rest.
“They ought to cut a first-rate fleece this
year.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes; and the wool is so clean,” said
Hubert. “There is nothing like having your
sheep within fences; no running about with
dogs and shepherds; they don’t get half the
dust and sand into their fleeces. But I’m afraid
this is about the last improvement Windāhgil
wants doing to it. It’s getting too settled and
finished. How I should like to tackle a big,
wild, half-stocked run in new country, with
no fencing done, and all the water to make!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You must bide your time, my boy,” said
Mr. Stamford, with a serious face. “It will
come some day—in another year or two, perhaps.
You mustn’t be in too great a hurry
to leave us all. Windāhgil is not such a bad
place.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“On the contrary, it’s getting too good
altogether. There’s only half enough work,
and next to no management required. Why,
you could do all the work yourself, governor,
with a steady working overseer!”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Thank you, my boy, for the compliment,”
said Mr. Stamford, taking off his hat.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, you know what I mean, father! so
don’t pretend you don’t. I’m not growing
cheeky because things have gone well lately;
but really there’s only enough managing to
keep you in exercise. It will half break my
heart to go away, but what’s the use of settling
down on a small comfortable place like this?
And how can I feel that I’m doing the best
for the family, when I hear of fellows like
Persse, and Grantley, and Philipson taking up
that new country beyond the Barcoo by the
thousand square miles; splendid downs covered
with blue grass and Mitchell grass? Grand
water, too, when you come upon it. Think
what all that country will be worth in a few
years.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I understand you, my boy,” said the proud
father, while a sudden emotion stirred his heart,
as he remembered the days of his own youth,
when he too had nourished the same high
thoughts of adventure and discovery, and had
played his part amid the dangers and privations
of frontier life. “You can talk it over with
Mr. Hope. We’ll see what can be done.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose,” said Hubert, after a while,
“when you’ve been up a week or ten days,
and I’ve talked over everything with mother
and the girls, from the regatta to the last new
waltz step, I may as well take my holiday. I
haven’t had one for three years. I begin to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>forget what the sea looks like, and I think
a month in the ‘big smoke’ and a few new
ideas will do me no harm.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Have your holiday, by all means, and enjoy
it too, my boy. Thank God, it is not a
question of money now. I have the fullest
belief in the sanitary value, mentally, of a trip
to the metropolis now and then.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank you, father. I’m sure it will
brush me up a little; besides, I want to go
to the Lands Office for certain reasons. I want,
above all, to have a good talk with this Mr.
Barrington Hope that I’ve heard so much
about.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’ll find him an uncommon sort of
person. The more you see of him, the more
you’ll like him, I feel certain. He is just the
man I should like you to make a friend of.
Try and get him to return with you, if he can
spare the time.”</p>

<p class='c017'>After the tea-things were cleared away, and
the large, steadfast, satisfactory table was left
free for reading, writing, or needlework—for
all of which purposes it was equally well
adapted—what a season of rational enjoyment
set in! The book box had been opened before.
The beautiful new uncut volumes, the titles of
which were received with exclamations of joy,
were placed upon a table. The collection of
new music was inspected, Linda going there and
then to the piano and dashing off a waltz;
making, besides, a running commentary upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>half-a-dozen songs which she and Laura were
going to learn directly there was a minute to
spare. Mr. Stamford took his accustomed chair,
and devoted himself to the <cite>Sydney Morning
Herald</cite>. Mrs. Stamford resumed the needlework
which is apparently a species of Penelope’s
web for all mothers of families, while Hubert
and Laura, somewhat apart from the rest, kneeling
on their chairs as if they had been children
again, made a cursory examination of the new
books, exclaiming from time to time at passages
or illustrations.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel inclined not to go to Sydney till after
I’ve read most of these books,” said Hubert;
“only that would make it so late. But it seems
a pity to leave such a lot of splendid reading.
Certainly there’s the Public Library in Sydney,
but I hardly ever go in there, because I find it
so hard to get out again. I did stay there once
till the lamps were lit. I had gone in for a few
minutes after breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a queer idea!” said Laura, laughing
outright. “How strange it must have felt to
have lost a whole day in Sydney. Never mind,
Hubert! There are a good many young men
to whom it would not occur to spend a whole
day in a library, public or private. Everything
in moderation, though. You must have another
station at your back before you can read all day
long.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Please God, we’ll have that too,” replied
he with a cheery smile, “or else the new country
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>will be taken up very fast. I don’t think Windāhgil
will see me after next shearing; that is
if the governor doesn’t forbid it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You don’t care about breaking our hearts,
you naughty boy!” said his sister, pressing her
cheek against his, as they looked over the same
book. “What are we all to do when you are
gone! You don’t think how lonely and miserable
the place will be.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Are you going to stay here all your life,
Laura? If you will, I will. But don’t think
I shall not feel the parting bitterly; I quite
tremble to think of it. How miserable I was
when you were in Sydney! But what is a man
to do? A few years of self-denial and hard life
now will make things easy for the rest of our
days. I am the working head of the family
now. Father is not the man he used to be.
And if I take life too easily for the next few
years, all these great opportunities will be gone,
and we shall regret it all the rest of our lives.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But the risk!” sighed Laura; “the wild
country, blacks, thirst, fever and ague. Every
paper brings news of some poor fellow losing
his life out there. What should we do if
you were taken? Remember how many lives
you carry about with you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You set a great value on Hubert Stamford,”
he said jokingly, while something in his eyes
showed a deeper feeling. “Other people
wouldn’t think any great loss had taken place
if I dropped. But men still go to sea, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>wrecks occur. Think how nice it will be when
I return bronzed, and illustrious, a gallant explorer
with a whole country-side taken up for
‘Stamford and Son,’ with runs to keep and to
sell, and to give away if we like.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m afraid you won’t be stopped; you are
an obstinate boy, though no one would think it.
I think I shall take possession of the piano and
sing you that lovely ‘Volkslied,’ though I’m
afraid my voice is weak after the night journey.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Laura had taken a few lessons in Sydney, very
wisely. Her naturally sweet, pure voice and
correct intonation were therefore much aided by
her later instruction.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You <em>have</em> improved,” said her brother. “I
never expected you to turn out such a <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>prima
donna</em></span>, though there is a tone in your voice that
always makes me wish to cry, as if that would be
the height of enjoyment. You brought up a
duet for me, didn’t you? Well, we won’t try it
to-night. You’re rather tired, I can see. We’ll
attack it some morning after breakfast, when
we’re fresh.”</p>

<p class='c017'>From this day forward, life flowed on with
uninterrupted felicity for the Windāhgil household.
It was nearly a week before the excitement
passed away of enjoying all the treasures
and novelties brought from the metropolis.
The weather even became favourable to the new
development of the garden, in which Mr.
Stamford and his wife were principally interested.
Genial showers refreshed the soil—always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>inclined to be thirsty in that region—so
that Mrs. Stamford’s ferns and flowers, and
plants with parti-coloured leaves, as well as her
husband’s new varieties of vegetables, shrubs,
and fruit trees, all partook of the beneficence of
the season.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for Hubert and his sisters, they rode and
drove about by day whenever the weather was
favourable; indeed sometimes when it was not.
They read steadily at the new books by night,
and by that means, and a few visits to old
friends in the neighbourhood, filled up every
spare moment in a mode of life each day of
which was consciously and unaffectedly happy.</p>

<p class='c017'>In addition to these quasi-pastoral occupations,
one day brought the exciting news that a new
proprietor—indeed a new family—was about to
arrive in the district—now the owner of a
sheep station distant from Windāhgil about
twenty miles had for some months, indeed since
the change of season, cherished hopes of selling
out to advantage.</p>

<p class='c017'>An astute, unscrupulous speculator, he had
purchased sheep largely, at low prices, directly
the weather broke, had crowded on to Wantabalree
all the stock it could hold—and more,
had sent the rest of his cheap purchase “on the
road.” This means, in Australia, travelling for
grass to a distant undefined point in a neighbouring
colony whence at any time they could be
ordered back; subsisting at free quarters, on
other men’s pastures till shearing.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>He then offered Wantabalree for sale, at the
high market price of the day, describing it as a
magnificent pastoral property with a stock of
sheep of the highest quality and breeding;
puffed up the grass, the improvements, the
homestead, the water supply, directly and indirectly,
and having done all this, awaited quietly
the usual victim provided with cash and deficient
in experience.</p>

<p class='c017'>In Australia, as in other countries probably, it
is a fact patent to observers of human nature
that the weak points of any particular locality
are rarely obtruded upon the incoming proprietor
or tenant. He is, in a general way,
prone to spend money on a liberal scale for the
first two or three years.</p>

<p class='c017'>The interests of other proprietors are, in a
way, identical. Assuming that the newly-arrived
purchaser has made an indifferent bargain—that
is, has misunderstood wholly the value
of his investment, or bought in total ignorance
of the peculiar drawbacks of the district, it
is rarely that any one volunteers to enlighten
him.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such information, if unfavourable, might
tend to depreciate the value of property locally.
It was none of their business. Every one had
enough to do to look after their own affairs.
They might want to sell out themselves some
day.</p>

<p class='c017'>Besides, after all, the seasons might prove
wet for years to come, in which case a tide of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>general prosperity would set in, quite sufficient
to float Colonel Dacre’s as well as the other
partially stranded argosies of the period.</p>

<p class='c017'>This was the mode of reasoning which mostly
obtained around Mooramah—possibly not
wholly unknown in other centres more or less
connected with financial operations.</p>

<p class='c017'>Even an experienced Australian pastoralist
may be placed at considerable disadvantage
when he comes to inspect station property in
a region previously unknown to him. He may
under-rate or over-estimate the changes in
pasture produced in varying seasons. He may
be wholly ignorant of probable or latent disease.
Summer’s heat or winter’s cold may surprise
him by their diverse results. Such men may
make—have indeed made—the most astonishing
mistakes in purchasing stations in unfamiliar
country. How much more so the wholly inexperienced,
newly-arrived buyer from Europe,
or Hindustan—ignorant of the very alphabet
of pastoral science! He is indeed delivered
over as a prey. The net is, in a manner, spread
for him. Unless he be clearly warned, and
indeed vigorously frightened away from this all-tempting
enclosure, he is very apt to be enmeshed.
After his entanglement—from which
except by the blindest chance he rarely emerges
save with despoiled plumage and drooping
crest—he can hear from his too reticent neighbours
doleful tales of loss and distress, a portion
of which information would have been sufficient
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>to deter him from (as he now believes) so
suicidal an investment.</p>

<p class='c017'>To do the Stamfords justice, they were not
the sort of people likely to stand by and see an
injustice perpetrated without protest. Colonel
Dacre, on arriving in the district, had called at
Windāhgil, and informing Mr. Stamford that
he felt disposed to buy Wantabalree, which was
then offered for sale with so many sheep, so
much purchased land, &amp;c., had asked his opinion
of the policy of the purchase.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert and his father looked at one another
for a moment. Then the younger man burst out—“I
think it’s a confounded shame that any
gentleman coming to a fresh district should be
taken in, utterly deceived in a purchase like this
one of Wantabalree. It is known to every
child within fifty miles that the place is over-stocked
by nearly one-half. The reason the
run looks so well is that a lot of sheep that
were travelling have just been put on. They
haven’t had time to eat down the grass yet. If
a dry season comes they’ll die like flies.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You must be careful in making statements
to Mr. Dealerson’s prejudice,” said his father.
“We are not on good terms with him. That
should be, perhaps, considered by Colonel Dacre.
At the same time, I endorse every word you
have said.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I know I hate the fellow like poison,” said
Hubert. “He’s mean and dishonest—and deserves
to be had up for false representation to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>boot; but I would say the same if he were my
own brother. The sale of Wantabalree with
the stock at present on it, under the advertisement
of a fairly-stocked run, is a deception and
a robbery. I give Colonel Dacre leave to repeat
my words to Mr. Dealerson or his friends.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I gather from what you say,” said the
Colonel; “that the stock upon Wantabalree
is in excess of what it would be safe to depasture
in ordinary seasons; that the buyer would
probably, in the event of an unfavourable season,
be at a disadvantage—--”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Such a disadvantage that he would lose
twenty or thirty thousand sheep to begin with,”
replied Hubert; “and even under the most
favourable circumstances the place could never
carry its present stock.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yet the sheep look very well—are indeed
fit for market—as I am informed by the person
the agents recommended me to consult.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“This is the finest season we have had for
five years. It is the best time of year also,”
said Hubert. “Any run about here would carry
double its ordinary stock for a few months—till
winter, for instance. If a third more sheep were
put on now, say on to this run, neither sheep
nor run would exhibit much difference until
the autumn was well over.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what would happen then?” asked the
Colonel.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then they would merely begin to starve—become
weak and die—thousand after thousand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>while all the survivors would be impoverished
and lessened in value.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Good Heavens!” said the astonished
soldier. “I never imagined such deceit could
be practised in a pastoral community. It
amounts to obtaining money under false pretences!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not legally,” said Mr. Stamford; “but every
word which my son has told you is substantially
true. Wantabalree with its present stock is
nothing better than a trap skilfully set to catch
the unwary purchaser. Mr. Dealerson is, so to
speak, an enemy of ours, but I will do Hubert
the justice to say that a friend acting similarly
would have fared no better at his hands.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well! forewarned is forearmed,” said the
colonel. “I feel deeply indebted to you, but
your conduct has been in marked contrast to
that of all the other residents to whom I have
spoken on the subject.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Unfortunately, there is too much caution or
apathy in matters of this sort,” said Mr.
Stamford. “We should have been delighted to
have you as a neighbour, believe me, but not at
such cost to yourself.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>About a week after this conversation Hubert
dropped the local paper he was reading in the
evening with such a sudden exclamation that his
mother and sisters looked up in mild astonishment.</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘Well I’m gormed!’ as Dan Peggotty has
it!” he said at length. “Nothing will ever
surprise me again as long as there is such a crop
of fools in the world—no wonder that rogues
like Dealerson flourish! After all I said too!
Listen to this! headed ‘Important Sale of
Station.—We have much pleasure in noticing
that our energetic and popular neighbour, Mr.
Dealerson, has completed the sale of his well-known
station, Wantabalree, with fifty-four
thousand six hundred sheep of a superior character,
to Colonel Dacre, a gentleman lately arrived
from England. Furniture, stores, station, horses
and cattle given in. The price is said to be
satisfactory.’ Well, the devil helps some
people,” said Hubert. “How that poor gentleman
could have run into the snare blindfold
after the talking to father and I gave him, I
can’t make out. Mark my words; he’s a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>dead man (financially) unless it’s going to rain
for years.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Dealerson is a very astute man,” remarked
Mr. Stamford, musingly. “As a persuasive talker
he has few equals. Fine, frank, engaging manner
too. Bold and ready-witted; I think I can
see how he managed it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well I can’t see—can’t make it out at all,”
said Hubert, “unless he is a mesmerist.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No doubt he made the most of being
on bad terms with Windāhgil. He would
rake up that old story of the disputed sheep;
tell it his own way; get that fellow Ospreigh,
who always goes about with him, to back him
up; also make small concessions such as furniture
and working plant; talk about the house
and garden—they would be attractive to a new
arrival; and if Colonel Dacre is at all impulsive—and
I think he is—he has thus landed him.
I wonder what the Colonel will think of
Dealerson about three years from this time?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ll tell him what <em>I</em> think of him, the next
time we meet in public,” said Hubert, squaring
his shoulders, while a dangerous light came into
his eyes. “If he could be tempted into giving
me the lie, I should like to have the pleasure of
thrashing him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Gently, my boy!” said Mr. Stamford; “we
must not set up ourselves as the redressers of
wrongs for Lower Mooramah, Few people are
in a position to discharge the duties of that
appointment. I honour your righteous indignation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>all the same, and trust you will always
retain an honest scorn of wrong and wrongdoers.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should hope so,” said Laura. “I can’t
imagine Hubert holding his tongue discreetly or
passing by on the other side. There are a
good many Levites in this part of the world,
I am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, my gracious!” said Linda, who was
reading a closely-written letter; “think of this!
Isn’t his name Colonel John Dacre, late of the
75th Regiment? There is one redeeming
feature about the affair, at all events.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What can that be?” said Laura and
Hubert both together.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why! there’s a distressed damsel in the
case. If I didn’t know better, I should think
Hubert must have heard about her. Listen to
this!” And she read aloud:—“‘I hear that
you are to have delightful neighbours. I was
told that Colonel Dacre was going to settle in
your neighbourhood. He has bought Wantabalree
station—young Groves told me last
night. He is a widower, handsome and middle-aged.
But I don’t mean him. He has an only
daughter, also a son. Think of that! Jane
Robinson met her at Mrs. Preston’s, where she
is staying. She says she is most sweet—handsome,
though not objectionable in the beauty-girl
line, clever, sensible, distinguished-looking,
&amp;c. Take care of Hubert, if you don’t want
to lose him for good and all.’ That’s from
Nellie Conway. Oh! isn’t that lovely?” and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>here Linda held the letter aloft, and danced for
joy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t see what difference it makes,” said
Hubert, gloomily, “except that there are three
people to be ruined instead of one. You girls
are always thinking of marriage and giving in
marriage.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Now don’t be provoking, Hubert,” said
Laura, coaxingly; “we know somebody who is
not always thinking about cattle and sheep.
Now, listen to me. How long will it take for
Mr. Dealerson to ruin them?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“About three years,” said Hubert; “depends
on the terms. Of course he’s got all the
Colonel’s cash, but he would take long-dated
bills rather than let him slip. Say three—three
and a half—that’s the very outside month.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That means that we are to have the society
and companionship of the very nice girl for
three or four years,” said Laura; “we can ask
her here for the last six months, you know,
I really think, Hubert, it won’t turn out such a
bad investment for the Colonel after all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’d better marry him out of pity,” said
Hubert; “get father to endorse his bills, and
that will effectually finish up the Stamford
family as well—stock, lock, and barrel.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ll complete the tragedy by marrying Mr.
Dealerson,” said Linda, “whom I shall afterwards
poison, then come on to the stage and
repent in white satin in my last agonies, having
by mistake taken some out of the same glass.
What a charming melodrama! Who says
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>there are no Australian romances possible in
real life?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No; but nonsense apart,” said Laura, “I
intend to make a friend of Miss Dacre; she
will be rather lonely. There are no decent
people within twenty miles of Wantabalree.
You must drive us over to call directly we
hear that they have arrived at the station.
It is a pleasant house, and the garden is lovely,
to give Mr. Dealerson his due.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You girls generally manage to persuade
everybody to do as you like,” said Hubert,
making believe to be sulky still, but putting his
arm round Laura’s waist. “It’s a pity you didn’t
tackle the Colonel about not buying the beastly
place, instead of father and me. He’d have
dropped it like a shot most likely.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Don’t you worry yourself any more about
it,” said Linda. “You have been ‘faithful’
to the Colonel—as Mrs. Christianson always
says—and done the honest and disagreeable.
Now let it rest.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’re bordering on a Levite,” retorted
her brother. “However, it was always the
fashionable side.”</p>

<p class='c017'>About a fortnight after the return of the
family party, when most of the books had
been read, when all the songs had been sung,
when every conceivable incident that had happened
in Sydney had been described and dilated
on, after every new phase of intellectual growth
in the three young minds had been stated and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>reviewed, Hubert Stamford relinquished his
charge of Windāhgil, and departed for the
metropolis on his long-expected holiday. Not
without tears shed by his female relatives did
he leave Windāhgil, that true and sacred home
in every sense of the word—a family abiding
place consecrated by fervent, unselfish love,
which had grown and deepened since childhood’s
hour with every opening year. How could
they think without a sudden pang of the
possibility of an accident—of one of the everyday
mischances in this age of rushing, resistless
forces harnessed to the car of man’s feverish
need—depriving them for ever of the sight of
that pleasant face, those frank, kind eyes, that
manly form! Such might happen—<em>had</em> happened.
Therefore, there were averted heads,
fast falling tears, as the signal sounded, and
the punctual, pitiless steam-giant bore away
the hope of Windāhgil from the little platform
at Mooramah.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Poor, dear Hubert!” said Linda, sneezing
violently, and then wiping her eyes; “it seems
ridiculous to cry, when he’s going away to enjoy
himself so much, and deserves it so well; but,
somehow, one can’t help it. There is a great
relief in tears. I think they are specially adapted
to the feminine temperament, a nice, comforting
sort of protest against circumstances. Dear me!
how lonely we shall be to-night.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I really believe father was afraid he would
‘give way’ too, as Nurse Allen used to say,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>said Laura, “and that was the reason he declined
to come. Never mind; we shall have
a telegram to-morrow. He must have been
much more lonely when we departed. Fancy
you or me at home, Linda, and all the rest of
the family away!”</p>

<p class='c017'>When Hubert Stamford had got over the
first feeling of parting with those whom he
loved better than his own life, the change of
place and scene which the fast-speeding mail
train rapidly furnished commenced to raise his
youthful spirits. After all, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>ce n’est que le
premier pas qui coûte</em></span>. Ah, but that first step!
Some people never can accomplish it, for things
good as well as evil, and a whole world of
delights and dangers remain unexplored.</p>

<p class='c017'>In Hubert Stamford’s case the initiatory stage
was now accomplished. The journey, more
or less eventful to home-keeping youths—the
first really accredited visit to the metropolis
since his manhood, with all things made easy
for him, was now about to take place. Imagination
commenced to conjure up the various
wonders and witcheries which he was about to
encounter, as well as the campaign of business
which he hoped to plan out and engineer definitely,
if not finally.</p>

<p class='c017'>Much revolving these pleasing and, in a
sense, profitable thoughts, the night became
reasonably far advanced. It then occurred to
him that, as he intended to have a long day
before him in Sydney, he might as well prepare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>for it by an orthodox allowance of sleep; so,
commending himself and those never-forgotten
idols of his heart to the mercy of the All-wise,
All-seeing Father of this wondrous world,
he wrapped himself in his rug and fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c017'>When he awoke the train was speeding down
the long incline which divides the mountain
world of rock and dell-rifted peak and alpine
summit, from the lowlands of the Nepean River.
A few more miles—another hour. Farms and
home-steadings, orangeries and orchards, vineyards
and cornfields, alternated with wide
pastures, dank with river fogs and morning dew,
darksome jungles of eucalyptus which the axe
of the woodman had as yet spared. Yet another
terminus, suburbs, smoke, a distant view of the
great sea, a turmoil of railway sheds, carriages,
tramcars, and cabs—Sydney!</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Comfortably established at Batty’s Hotel, to
the management of which he had taken the
trouble to telegraph for a room, and received
with that pleasing welcome accorded to the
guest who is known to spend liberally and pay
promptly, Hubert found the situation, as he
surveyed the harbour from the balcony with
after-breakfast feelings, to be one of measureless
content mingled with sanguine anticipation.</p>

<p class='c017'>Oh! precious spring-time of life! Blest
reflex of the golden days of Arcady. What
might we not have done with thy celestial
hours, strewn with diamonds and rubies more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>precious than the fabled valley of the Arabian
voyager, had we but have divined their value.
For how much is it now too late? The scythe-bearer,
slow, passionless, pitiless, has passed on.
The irrevocable winged hours have fled. Opportunity,
fleet nymph with haunting eyes and
shining hair, has disappeared in the recesses of
the charmed forest, and we, gazing hopelessly
on the shore of life’s ocean, hear from afar the
hollow murmur of the maelstrom of Fate—the
rhythmic cadence of the tideless waves of eternity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert Stamford, more fortunate, had all the
world before him; moreover, nothing to do but
elect, with the aid of a sufficiency of cash, leisure
and introductions, to what particular pleasures
he should devote the cheerful day. He revolved
in his mind several kinds of entertainments of
which he would like to partake, but finally resolved
to present himself at the office of the
Austral Agency Company, having a great desire
to see the wonderful Barrington Hope, of whom
he had heard so much, as also to sound him as
to a Queensland stock speculation. He would
leave a card for Mr. Grandison at his club. If
no engagement turned up he would take a
steamer to Manly Beach, and afterwards go
to the theatre.</p>

<p class='c017'>Having mapped out the day to his satisfaction,
Hubert betook himself to the Austral
Agency Company’s offices, by the splendour of
which he was much struck, and sent in his card.</p>

<p class='c017'>He was not suffered to remain long in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>outer office, but was promptly ushered into the
manager’s room and confronted with the head
of the department in person. Doubtless it was
a mutual pleasure. Hubert was impressed with
the autocrat’s appearance, the manner, as well as
the reserve of power which in every word and
gesture Barrington Hope displayed. The latter,
on the other hand, did full justice to the bold,
sincere countenance, the manly, muscular figure
of his young visitor. Reading between the lines,
he saw there written quenchless energy and love
of adventure, yet shrewd forecast.</p>

<p class='c017'>“This youngster is not like other men,” Mr.
Hope said to himself, after the first direct,
searching gaze. “He only wants opportunity,
encouragement, and the backing-up of
capital to become a successful speculator. He
has enterprise, undying pluck, persistent energy,
and still sufficient apprehensiveness to shield him
from disaster. We must send him along. He
will do well for himself and the company. His
complexion and features are different—but how
like he is to his sister!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Much of this he may have thought, but
merely said, “Mr. Hubert Stamford, I am sincerely
glad to make your acquaintance. Having
had the pleasure of knowing your family, I was
really anxious to meet you. I venture to predict
that we shall become friends and allies. I
trust you left all well at Windāhgil, and that
the season continues favourable.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Perfectly well, thank you,” said Hubert.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>“My father desired to be particularly remembered
to you. My sisters have not yet left off
describing their pleasant visit to Sydney. The
season is a trifle dry, but otherwise everything
that can be desired.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thanks very much! Tell your sisters when
you write that a great melancholy fell upon me
when they left. We had been so much together
in town, fortunately for me.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have been waiting for an opportunity to
thank you for the assistance you gave us at a
very critical time,” said Hubert. “My father
has, I daresay, told you all we thought about it.
But I always determined to speak for myself on
the subject.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It was a speculation, a purely business risk,
which I undertook,” replied Mr. Hope. “I
told your father so at the time. That it has
resulted so favourably, is of course, most satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I see your point. All the same, it was
more than fortunate for us, and for Windāhgil,
that you happened to take that precise commercial
risk at that particular time. It is,
besides, more agreeable to work financially with
some people than others. And now, will you
come and lunch with me, so that we may have a
talk?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am really sorry,” said Mr. Hope, looking
at his watch, “but shall not have five minutes
to spare till five o’clock, when I should like to
consult you on a business matter. If, afterwards,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>you will dine with me at the club, at seven
sharp, I will talk as much as you like.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That will do as well, indeed better,” said
Hubert, “as the day will be over, which is a
great advantage if one is to enjoy oneself. I
have a call or two to make, so adieu for the
present!” Making a direct point for the club
which Mr. Grandison ornamented, Hubert was
fortunate in discovering that gentleman just
emerging from the strangers’ room with an
elderly gentleman, whom Hubert recognised as
Colonel Dacre.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How are you, Hubert, my boy?” said
Grandison. “What a man you’ve grown!
Nothing like bush air. Father quite well?
Mother and the girls? Glad to hear it. Let
me introduce you to Colonel Dacre, soon to be
a neighbour of yours at Wantabalree.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m very sorry for it,” blurted out Hubert.
“That is, in one sense, as I told Colonel Dacre
before. I said then, and think now, that he
made a bad bargain. That apart, I am, of
course, delighted to hear that he is coming with
his family to live so near us.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! indeed; I didn’t know you had met
before.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The Colonel bowed, and looking slightly
embarrassed, for a veteran, before so youthful a
soldier as Hubert, said, “I ought to thank Mr.
Stamford and his father for their sincere and
kindly advice about my purchase. I did not
take it wholly, and indeed acted on my own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>judgment and that of other friends in buying
Wantabalree. But I shall always feel grateful
for their well-meant counsel.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why, how is this, Hubert?” said Mr.
Grandison with an important air. “You seem
to have been very decided on the subject. My
friend Barterdale, under whose financial advice
Colonel Dacre acted, says he is credibly informed
that it is a most paying purchase. And
Dealerson says it is the best bargain of the day.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“For <em>him</em>, no doubt; but Dealerson is a liar
and a rogue,” said Hubert, bluntly. “I will tell
him so to his face, if ever I meet him. As for
Mr. Barterdale, he keeps Dealerson’s account,
and perhaps may not wish to offend a good
customer. The Colonel has been deceived and
robbed, that’s all! And having said enough,
perhaps more than is polite, I shall not speak
another word about the affair, except to assure
Colonel Dacre that all Windāhgil is at his
service in the way of neighbourly assistance.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thanks very much!” said the Colonel,
looking rather crestfallen; “but have you
heard” Hubert felt quite ashamed of his savage
sentence as he remarked the old gentleman’s
humility of tone—“the price I have sold the
fat sheep at?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No,” replied Hubert, “I can’t say that I
have; but, assuming that the wool does as well
you are still in a dangerous position, with an
overcrowded run. However, I sincerely trust
that it may be otherwise.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>“And so do I,” said Mr. Grandison; “but
you’ve done your duty, my boy, and Providence
must do the rest. Colonel Dacre is coming to
lunch with me. Here’s the phaeton, jump in
and you will see Mrs. Grandison and Josie,
besides another young lady that you haven’t
before met.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I asked Mr. Hope to lunch,” said Hubert;
“but as he can’t come I am free. And so, if
Colonel Dacre isn’t offended by my plain speaking,
I shall be most happy.”</p>

<p class='c017'>At luncheon Mrs. Grandison appeared with
the fair Josie, who welcomed Hubert so warmly
that he began to think that he was mistaken in
the opinion he had previously formed of both
these ladies. Certainly, in his boyhood, they had
expressed remarkably little interest in his welfare.
But being slow to think evil, he took himself
severely to task, and decided that Mrs. Grandison
was a warm-hearted matron, and Josie a very
attractive-looking girl.</p>

<p class='c017'>At that moment a young lady entered the
room and apologised to Mrs. Grandison in so
sweet a voice, and with so much natural grace
of manner, for being late that his too susceptible
heart was immediately led captive.
Miss Josie’s charms receded to a register below
zero, where they remained as unalterably fixed
as the “set fair” in an aneroid barometer in
a drought.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Allow me to introduce our cousin, Mr.
Hubert Stamford,” said the elder lady; “Miss
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>Dacre, I think you are to be neighbours in the
bush.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am happy to meet Mr. Stamford,” said
the young lady, bestowing a gaze on Hubert
so honest, kindly, and yet questioning, that his
subjection was complete. “Though, from what
papa tells me, it is not his fault that we are not
in some other district.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I was acting against my own interest—against
all our interests,” Hubert said, rather
nervously. “Believe me that the whole family
were most anxious to have you as neighbours.
So you must give me credit for honesty of
intention.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall never doubt that, from all I hear,”
said Miss Dacre. “Papa is rather sanguine, I
am afraid.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And perhaps I am not sufficiently so,” said
Hubert; “It’s all over now. Let us find a
pleasanter subject. When do you think of
going up?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! next week at farthest. Are we not,
papa?”</p>

<p class='c017'>The Colonel nodded. “I’m enthusiastically
fond of the country. I hear there’s such a nice
cottage, quite a pretty garden, a flowing stream,
a mountain, cows and pigs, and chickens, a fair
library—in fact, almost an English home.
You’ll admit that, I hope, Mr. Stamford?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’ll admit anything,” said Hubert; “the
homestead’s the best in the district. My mother
and sisters will be charmed to put you <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>au fait</em></span> in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>all matters of bush housekeeping. And now,
Josie, are you going to the opera on Thursday
night, and would you like a cavalier?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We were thinking of it,” said she. “Mother
was doubtful, and father doesn’t care about opera.
If you can get some one else, I have no doubt
Mrs. Stopford would be glad to act as chaperon,
and Miss Dacre and I would go—if she would
like it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! above all things,” said that young
lady; “I am always ready to hear opera. And
I hear you have a very good company here. I
was stupid enough, when I left England, to
think I should never hear Italian opera again.
I feel ashamed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We are not quite barbarians, nor yet copper-coloured,”
said Josie; “though I am afraid we
Sydney girls can’t boast of our complexions.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am quite ready to make recantation of all
my errors,” said Miss Dacre. “I suppose it
need not be done publicly, in a white sheet. I am
divided between that and writing to the <cite>Times</cite>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I believe you will make the best bush-woman
possible,” said the Colonel, with an
admiring glance. “Only we both have so much
to unlearn. I didn’t expect to see a room like
this, for instance, or such appointments,” he
continued, raising a glass of claret pensively to
his lips.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s rather a bad thing for us, pappy, as we
have to live in the real bush, don’t you think?
We must forget it all as soon as possible.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“It won’t make the least difference to you,
my dear,” said Mrs. Grandison. “If you had
seen Hubert’s sisters here you would have been—well—astonished
to see such girls come out of
the bush. For some reasons I begin really to
think it would be better for all of us to live
there.” Here she glanced reflectively at Josie,
who looked scarcely as self-possessed as usual.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall not say another word about bush
matters,” said Hubert. “They will keep.
When Miss Dacre comes up she will judge for
herself. If my opinion is requested, I shall be
happy to give it, but shall not volunteer advice.
Will your brother travel up with you, Miss
Dacre?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Willoughby went to stay a few days with
a ship friend, who lives near Penrith, I think
it is, but he is quite as enthusiastic as I am
about beginning life in earnest. He will be in
town again on Friday.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Come and dine with us on Saturday, then,
Hubert,” said Mrs. Grandison, and I’ll ask
Mr. Hope and one or two of your rude bush
pioneers. Josie, can’t you get a couple of young
ladies for Hubert’s benefit and to show Mr.
Dacre?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t think Hubert wants any more young
ladies,” said Josie mischievously; “but I’ll ask
the Flemington girls to come in—one of them
plays marvellously and the other sings. Her
voice is very like Parepa’s.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The dinner was a success, the party to the
opera having gone off without a drawback to
the unbroken joyousness of the affair. The
Misses Flemington came and performed such
musical feats as were expected of them, and
Miss Dacre admitted that she had not heard
a voice unprofessional for years to equal May
Flemington’s. She wondered, indeed, what she
could have been thinking of to imagine that
when she came to Australia all artistic luxuries
were to be banished from her thoughts.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The fact is,” she said, “we are frightfully
narrow and prejudiced in England. We know
a great deal about France, Germany and the
Continent generally, because we are always running
backwards and forwards. But of our own
countrymen in Australia and New Zealand we
know next to nothing. I was going to say as
little as about Timbuctoo, but we do really
know something about Africa, because the missionaries
tell us, and we have returned evangelists
from Borioboolah Gha, even from Fiji and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>New Zealand. But of Australia we know
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“When you go home again, Miss Dacre,”
said Hubert, “you will be able to do battle for
us, I see. We must make you Agent-General,
or Ambassadress, if any such post is vacant.
I am sure you will do us justice.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Indeed I shall, but I feel ashamed of the
ludicrous notions which I brought out with me.
No one would think of going down to Yorkshire
and saying, ‘I suppose you have nothing
newer in songs than “The days when we went
gipsying,”’ or asking the Edinburgh people if
they had ever seen a bicycle. But really men
and women who have had ‘advantages,’ as they
are called, do come out here (five weeks from
England) and expect to see you living a sort
of Fenimore Cooper life, cutting down trees,
‘trailing’ your enemies, and sleeping in wigwams
or huts only once removed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Perhaps a portion of this is natural enough,”
said Hubert, “we are a long way from town.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, it is not natural,” said Miss Dacre;
“because have not so many of our friends come
out for generations past? And then for us to
think that their sons and daughters were to grow
up as clods and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>belles sauvages</em></span>!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It will all come right in time,” said Hubert.
“It doesn’t hurt us, if it pleases them, always
excepting people”—here he bowed—“whom
we don’t want to have wrong impressions about
us. Wait till you get fairly settled at Wantabalree,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>Miss Dacre, and you’ll lose a few more
illusions.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! but I don’t want to lose all of them,”
replied the young lady. “Some of them are so
nice, that I want to retain them in full freshness.
I am going to keep pigs and poultry and send
wonderful hams to England to show our people
what we can do. I am going to be a great
walker, and write letters about my impressions
to the magazines. I am sure they will do good.
Then I shall have a good collection of books,
and grow quite learned, besides making myself
acquainted with all the people round about, and
doing good among the poor. I am certain there
is a great field for an energetic person like
myself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“True!” replied Hubert reflectively. “Australians
are rarely energetic, and your programme
is excellent. I fully agree with all
your plans and ideas, but I am only afraid there
may be difficulties in the way of carrying them
out.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You really are most disappointing people—you
colonists.” Here Hubert held up his
finger warningly.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! I forgot. I am not to call you colonists,
but to talk to you as if you were like
everybody else—is not that so? Well—but
you <em>do</em> disappoint me. There is an air of
guarded toleration, or mild disapproval, which
I observe among all of you when I begin to
talk of carrying out reforms. You are very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>polite, I admit; but tell me now, why should
I not? Surely one does not come all this way
to do only what everyone else does!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Josie laughed. Hubert looked sympathetic,
but did not offer an explanation. Then Mrs.
Grandison took up the running. “My dear,
you are quite right in wishing to do everything
in your power in the way of good; it is what
every girl ought to strive after. It would keep
them out of mischief, and so on. But where
you English people—when you first come out,
not afterwards—differ a little from us is that
you are all going to set us benighted colonists
right, and to improve us in a great many ways.
You say, “I only want to do my duty—just as
one would do in England,” but the idea is that
you can improve things ever so much.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, perhaps there may be a feeling that a
good deal appears to be left undone; but the
intention is to do our duty in that state of
life, &amp;c.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Quite true,” assented Mrs. Grandison;
“but remember what you said, that so many of
the best people of the old country had come out
here. May not they and their children have
worked to some purpose, with results like the
Miss Flemington’s music and singing?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, that does seem probable, but a great
deal remains undone; you must admit that,
surely?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am afraid many of us are not up to the
mark in our duties, but the same kind of persons
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>would perhaps have done no better in an English
county. But I could show you people who pass
their lives in doing good—who hardly do anything
else, in fact.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And for what is not done,” said Hubert,
who had been regarding Mrs. Grandison’s defence
of Australian institutions with a slightly surprised
air, “there is commonly some reason,
though not visible to a newly arrived young
lady like yourself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thank you, Mr. Stamford. But why did
you not call me a ‘new chum’ while you were
about it? I know you all look down on us.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We do not call ladies ‘new chums,’” said
Hubert gravely, bowing slightly at the same
time. “And I really must decline any more
passages of arms about my native land. I hope
you will like it, and us too on further acquaintance.
I will hand you over to my sisters, who
will argue the point with you at any length, and
if you can inoculate each other with your different
opinions, it will be mutually advantageous.”
With which diplomatic recommendation Mr.
Hubert Stamford looked at his watch and bowed
himself out. “I mustn’t be late for this appointment
with Barrington Hope,” he told himself.
“It is important enough, and though I could
sit and argue with that nice, fresh, enthusiastic
Miss Dacre all day, yet ‘business is business.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>From which latter proverb, it may be inferred
that Mr. Stamford, junior, although by no means
averse to the proper and gallant attendance upon
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>ladies which every man of his age should hold
to be a part of his knightly devoir, was yet in
the main a practical youth, likely in the long run
to win his spurs in the modern tourney of
pastoral commerce.</p>

<p class='c017'>After thinking over the points of the coming
conference, he signalled to a hansom cabby, and
was taken up by that modern benefactor of the
late, the imprudent, and the unlucky, and
whirled swiftly to the offices of the Austral
Agency Company. Here Mr. Hope had arranged
to meet a Mr. Delamere, who was anxious to
acquire a pastoral property in the new country,
Queensland, just opened and in every man’s
mouth. This gentleman had but lately arrived
from England. In a kind of way he was consigned
to the company by one of the English
directors, who happened to be his uncle.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Delamere, senior, had known the colonies
in former years, and being fully aware that high
hope and lofty purpose, even when combined
with an available capital, do not altogether make
up for total inexperience of all Australian
pastoral matters, had besought the manager
of the Melbourne branch of the Austral Agency
Company to advise the cadet of his house.</p>

<p class='c013'>“I am aware, my dear Thornton,” he wrote,
“that in a general way it is thought better that
a newly arrived young gentleman should work
out his own destiny in Australia—that after
repeated falls and losses he learns to run alone,
and may be trusted henceforth to move more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>circumspectly than if he had been ‘shepherded’
from the first. But I dissent from this theory.
The falls are often serious; after some losses
there is nothing left. I prefer a partner, such
a one as I had myself thirty years ago if possible.
There ought to be a few well-bred youngsters
knocking about who know everything that can
be known about stations and stock but are held
back for want of capital. Such a one could
supply the experience, while Frank Delamere
would find the capital. The old joke used to
be that in two or three years the new arrival
had acquired all the experience and the colonist
all the cash. This reads smartly, but is false
enough, like many <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bons mots</em></span> both in the Old
World and the New. Where was there ever a
better man than my old overseer, Jock Maxwell,
afterwards partner, and now deservedly pastoral
magnate? He could work twice as hard as I ever
did; he knew station life <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ab ovo</em></span>. He was
honest to a fault. He—but I always prose
when I get on this topic. It is enough to say
that I had sufficient sense to form this estimate
of his character and act upon it, ‘whereby,’ as
Captain Cuttle has it, I am now writing from
Greyland Manor, near Glastonbury Thorn,
instead of being a white slave in a counting
house, or the half-pay pauper generally known
as a retired military officer.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Therefore—a convenient, if illogical expression—I
charge you to procure a good steady
‘pardner’ for Frank, who will see that his ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>thousand, perhaps more, if need be, is not
wasted or pillaged before he cuts his wisdom
teeth as a bushman. Draw at sight, when
investments are made with your consent.—Yours
ever sincerely,</p>

<div class='c015'>“<span class='sc'>Robert Delamere</span>.”</div>
<p class='c012'>#/</p>

<p class='c017'>This was the business on which the three men
met on this day at the Austral Agency Company’s
office. Before this momentous interview a certain
amount of preliminary work had been done.
Letters and ‘wires’ had circulated freely
between Windāhgil, Sydney and Melbourne,
from which city the newly-fledged intending
purchaser had recently been summoned. Permission
had been reluctantly granted by Mr.
Stamford, who foresaw years of separation from
the son and heir, who had never cost him an
anxious moment as to his conduct. The affair
was tearfully discussed by Mrs. Stamford and
the girls, who thought life would no longer
be worth living at Windāhgil when Hubert’s
merry voice and unfailing good spirits were
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Why do people want to change and alter
things—to go away and bring sorrow and misery
and destruction—no, I mean desolation—on those
they love?” demanded Linda. “And we are all
so happy here! It seems cruel of Hubert to take
it into his head to go to Queensland—all among
blacks, and fever, and sunstroke, and everything.”
Here she got to the end of her list of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>probable disasters, and though sensible that her
climax was not effective, was fain to conclude,
“Don’t you think it’s too bad, mother?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We shall feel dear Hubert’s absence deeply,
bitterly, I grant,” said the fond mother; “but
he is animated by the very natural desire of all
high-spirited young men to improve the fortunes
of the family, and to distinguish himself
in a career which is open to all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But the danger, mother!” said Laura, in a
low voice; “you remember poor young Talbot,
whom the blacks killed last month, and Mr.
Haldane, who died of fever. Suppose—oh!
suppose—--”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Suppose the house fell down and killed, us
all,” said Mr. Stamford, rather testily, for the
purpose of hiding his own inward disquiet,
which, though not expressed, was as deeply felt
as that of his wife and daughters. “It’s no use
talking in that way, as if a young man had
never gone out into the world before. Boys go
to sea and into the army every day of the
year. People must make up their minds to it.
It is a grand opportunity, Mr. Hope says, and
may not occur again.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall hate Mr. Hope,” said Linda, “if he
has induced Hubert to go into this speculation
along with some one no one knows, into a
country which half the people, it seems to me,
never come back from. But I suppose those
mercantile men don’t care.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You mustn’t be unjust, Linda,” interposed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Laura. “Whatever Mr. Hope has done has
been in Hubert’s interest, we may feel sure.
He has always been most friendly to the family.
And you must remember that Hubert has been
lately always pining to go to Queensland, and
talking about wasting his life here in this old
settled district.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What’s the use of being miserable if you
can’t be unjust to some one?” retorted Linda.
“If you felt as deeply as I do, Laura, you
wouldn’t talk in that cold-blooded way. I can
see the whole thing. Mr. Hope and his company
are anxious to establish a great station
property out in Queensland, or Kimberley, or
King George’s Sound, or wherever it is, and
they have pitched upon poor Hubert as a likely
victim for the sacrifice. That’s the whole
thing! They’re regular Molochs, and Mr.
Hope is the officiating High Priest—nothing
else. I wonder how he’d look with a garland
of oak leaves, like the Druid in <cite>Norma</cite>?”
Here Linda’s feelings, brought to a climax by a
smile which she detected on Laura’s countenance
at her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>mélange</em></span> of metaphors, became too much
for her, and pressing her handkerchief to her
eyes, she retreated to her bedroom.</p>

<p class='c017'>All the high contracting parties having sent
in unqualified assent, it but remained for Mr.
Hope to introduce the young men to each other—the
representatives of the Parent Land and
that Greater Britain which has now in the South
and West attained such vast proportions; also
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>to reduce to writing the terms of an agreement
by which the two men bound themselves to
work together for their joint benefit as graziers,
explorers, stock and station proprietors for the
fixed term of five years.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Delamere was to place to the credit of
the new firm of Delamere and Stamford the sum
of ten thousand pounds, which would be amply
sufficient for the purchase of stock, the taking
up, or even securing at second-hand, the requisite
areas of Crown lands in new or partially
settled country.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert Stamford, on the other hand, “did
agree and contract to personally manage and
conduct the details of the joint concern—to
superintend the management of stock, the hiring
of station hands, the purchase of stores, and
whatever work, either of exploration, travel, or
management, might be found necessary, for
which he was, in consideration of such personal
knowledge and experience of the management of
stock and stations by him acquired, to be placed
and held to be the possessor of one-third share
of the said property and of the profits of said
stock and stations.”</p>

<p class='c017'>These provisions and declarations were
embodied in an agreement, which was drawn up
by the company’s solicitor and submitted by
him to Mr. Worthington for inspection and
approval.</p>

<p class='c017'>That gentleman, as instructed, wrote to Mr.
Stamford, senior, who, it would appear, made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>some subsequent communication to him,
inasmuch as Mr Hope received a letter signed
Worthington, Wardell and Co., which briefly
but clearly stated that his friend and client, Mr.
Stamford, of Windāhgil, approved generally of
the terms of the agreement entered into by his
son and Mr. Delamere, and that he was quite
willing that he should enter into such an
arrangement, and that Mr. Hope, of the Austral
Agency Company, had his full confidence and
trust. But that he desired his son to place a proportionate
sum of ready money to the credit of
the firm, and not to enter it wholly upon the
outlay of another. And therefore that he had
placed in Mr. Worthington’s hands securities to
the value of five thousand pounds, which sum
they were ready to pay over on Mr. Hope’s
order to that effect.</p>

<p class='c017'>Upon the receipt of this letter, Mr. Hope at
once proposed that the share of the profits to
which Mr. Hubert Stamford was entitled under
the agreement should be altered to one half, inasmuch
as his superior knowledge and experience
would be in value to the interest of the other
moiety of the ten thousand pounds to be advanced
by Mr. Delamere, and would thus equalise
matters. This was at once agreed to, on the part
of Mr. Delamere and the Melbourne manager of
the company acting in his interests, upon which
the agreement was “signed, sealed, and delivered.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Nothing now remained but for Hubert to
pay a farewell visit to Windāhgil, for the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>purpose of settling up what personal business
he might have, to take leave of the family, and
then to journey into a far country after the
fashion of the princes, prodigals, and younger
sons of historic ages.</p>

<p class='c017'>Place and time being appointed for the newly-joined
partners to meet and take ship for their
destination, Hubert Stamford commenced all
requisite preparation for a start homewards.</p>

<p class='c017'>He had no further heart for the pleasures of
Sydney—the ordinary distractions of a young
man palled upon him. He felt like a general
whose army is about to march for the imminent
battle—like a soldier picked for a forlorn hope,
or an advanced guard. The meaner pleasures
revolted him. Balls and picnics, theatres and
concerts, were but the straws and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>débris</em></span> of life’s
ocean. The argosy which carried his fortunes
was about to sail with canvas spread and
streamers flying. Would she return gold-laden,
or would the cold ocean engulf her as so many
other fairer barks which, “youth at the prow
and pleasure at the helm,” had sailed away
through the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>ingens aequor</em></span>, and returned nevermore?
Was it to be so with him?</p>

<p class='c017'>Might it be a proved success, a wider experience
with the praise of all men, the joyful
tears and triumph of those who loved him?
Or that other thing? Who could tell? He
could only resolve to do and to dare worthily,
whatever might befall, for their dear sakes.</p>

<p class='c017'>Miss Dacre, with her father and brother, had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>left town for Wantabalree, being anxious to be
settled in their new abode. The Colonel, distrusting
more deeply day by day the wisdom of
his purchase, had become restless and uneasy;
he wanted to see with his own eyes how things
went on, and to justify himself, if possible, for
the investment, at which more than one disinterested
critic had shaken his head. Willoughby
Dacre, an ardent inexperienced youngster, who
thought Australian squatter life made up wholly
of galloping about on horseback, and lying
under shady trees eating tropical fruits, was also
impatient to be in the thick of the half-Arab
life he pictured to himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>Rosalind Dacre, though the chief doubter and
dissentient, was yet eager to see with her own
eyes this land of promise, which was, according
to Hubert, to fail so woefully in performance,
and also to put in practice her own ideas of
“the gentle life” as possible in Australia; at
the same time to comfort her father and aid in
the household management.</p>

<p class='c017'>For all these reasons the Dacre family had
departed; and Hubert, calling at their hotel,
found to his surprise and slight dissatisfaction,
that they had gone the day before, a note of
the Colonel’s alone remaining <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en souvenir</em></span>, in
which he thanked him for his well-meant,
valuable advice, and trusted they would
meet in the neighbourhood of their respective
stations.</p>

<p class='c017'>For some unexplained reason Hubert read
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>this trivial note several times, and then tearing
it up in a reflective manner, walked slowly
towards his own hostelry.</p>

<p class='c017'>“When do you think of leaving, Hubert?”
said Mr. Hope, as they were talking over
districts and markets, land laws and tenures,
railways and syndicates, all more or less bearing
on the great pastoral central idea. “When
shall you go home?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“On Friday, I think. I am getting tired of
town, and everything is fully arranged.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Everything is settled that needs settling, and
nothing more can be done until you young men
manage to get pretty far back, and make your
first deal in new country. It’s a gloriously
exciting, adventurous kind of life, this starting
to take up new country. I often wish I’d taken
to it myself in youth, instead of this branch of
the business.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Living in town seems a pleasant life
enough,” said Hubert. “You have all sorts
of things that we people in the bush have to do
without.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And we need them all,” said the elder man.
“This office life is one eternal grind, month
after month, year after year. But I don’t wish
to complain. I suppose all men get ‘hypped’
sometimes.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I never do,” laughed Hubert; “the day’s
never long enough for me; but I suppose
I soon should if I lived all the year round in
town. It’s being so much in the open air that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>saves one. But why don’t you clear out to
Windāhgil for a change? Come home with me.
The governor and my mother are always expecting
you to send them word you’re coming.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish to heaven I could,” said the man
of the city, looking enviously at Hubert’s
cheery countenance and unworn features; “but
I can’t find the time at present. However,
I promise to turn up at Mooramah—isn’t that
your railway town?—some time before
Christmas. I shall count the days till I can,
I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall be away then, I am sorry to say,”
said Hubert. “I should like to have taken
you all over the old place. There are one or
two decent views, and rides and drives no end.
However, the girls and the young brothers
know them as well as I do; you must
get them to do the honours. Oh! I forgot,
too—you can drive them over to the Dacres’.
But you mustn’t put it off too long. Still, they
can’t be ruined within a year or eighteen months,
anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And perhaps not then,” said Mr. Hope,
with a smile. “Friends might intervene
judiciously, you know. It won’t be Mr.
Dealerson’s fault if they pull through, however.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“No, hang him! However, there must be
Dealersons in the world, I suppose. They act
as a kind of foil to honest men, and serve as
transparencies to show roguery in all its glory.
Well, good-bye till then. We may meet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>before Delamere and I start for the ‘Never-Never’
country.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>When Hubert Stamford beheld his sisters
and his younger brother, who had driven to
Mooramah to meet him, he felt more like a
stranger and pilgrim than he ever expected to
feel in that familiar spot. He was there with
them, but not of them, as it were. He was to
stay a month or so at Windāhgil—only a month
at the dear old place where he had lived ever
since he could remember anything; he was to
go over all the familiar scenes once more, and
then—to leave it, certainly for years, perhaps
for ever. After the first warm greeting the
girls looked inquiringly at him; the tears came
into Laura’s eyes. “Oh, how happy we are to
see you, our own dear Hubert; but to think
you are going away so soon nearly breaks my
heart!” she said.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He looks wonderfully well. Town life—not
too much—always refines people,” said
Linda, with an air of tender criticism; “but I
think there’s a hard look about his eyes. I
suppose it’s making up his mind to this grand
new speculation.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You see exactly the same Hubert Stamford
that went away, you little analysing duffer, but
is it my fault that I have had to move with the
rest of the world? Do you want me to stay at
home and become a superior sort of ‘cockatoo,’
and are you and Laura—if it is to come to that—prepared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>to remain at Windāhgil for the rest
of your lives?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish I could,” groaned Laura; “but
as you say, we must move with the rest of the
world. Still these separations are heart-breaking.
You needn’t mind us overmuch, dear; but
we are women, remember, and you must let us
have our cry out. It does us good, and relieves
the overcharged heart.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Very well, I consent. But you must
manage it all to-day. To-morrow must be
sunshine, and only blue sky appear till I depart.
But there’s a whole month or more yet. Think
of that! We can be ever so happy all that
time. Now, to change the subject. Have you
seen anything of the Dacres?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That means Miss Dacre, I suppose,” said
Linda. “Oh, yes; we went to call almost
directly we heard they were up. Said we
thought they might want something. That
was how we described our curiosity.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what do you think of her?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She’s a dear, sweet creature, and Laura and I
have agreed that if you don’t fall in love with her,
your taste isn’t as good as we believed it to be.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She’s very nice,” said Hubert, with society
nonchalance; “but I’ve got something else to
do besides falling in love for the next three or
four years. Besides, she mightn’t condescend
to a humble colonist like me. But tell me,
Laura, what was there about her that you were
struck with chiefly?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>“Several things,” said Laura, reflectively.
“She is a high-caste, cultured girl in every
respect, though she is so fresh, and natural,
and plain in all her ways, that people who
are always looking out for the airs and graces
of the Lady Clara Vere de Vere species might
be disappointed in her.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All that I can understand and generally
agree with,” said Hubert. “What next?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She is awfully energetic,” continued Laura.
“Of course, there are plenty of girls in this
country that are, but she never seems to have
any notion of repose from the time she gets up,
which is early, till bed-time. She reads and
writes and does her housekeeping, and walks,
and rides and drives, and what she calls visits
the poor (oh, there is quite a good story about
that, which I must tell you!), all with unvarying
industry.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She is a newly imported broom,” said
Hubert, “and naturally sweeps with effectiveness.
It will slow down a little with time. But it’s a
fault on the right side. Tell us the story,
Laura dear.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>“Well,” said Laura, putting on a Scheherazade
expression of countenance, “it appears that
Miss Dacre, having been used to be good to
the poor of the village near where they lived
in England, could not get on without them.
Much to her surprise, she found them scarce
in the neighbourhood of Wantabalree. Mr.
Dealerson did not ‘believe in’ poor people,
and generally ‘fed out,’ ‘blocked,’ or bought out
small holders. At length, in one of her rides,
she came upon an old couple living in a miserable
hut, the man feeble and half-blind, both apparently
destitute; their one little girl was barefooted
and in rags. They told a pitiful story of
having been deceived in the matter of a free selection—which,
of course, she couldn’t understand—and
deserted by their children. Charmed by
their evident poverty and artless expressions of
gratitude, she gave them what silver she had,
and promised them employment.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Her intention was good,” said Hubert. “I
can guess the kind of people they were; but it
speaks well for her kindness of heart.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>“Nothing could be kinder, I am sure; but
I grieve to say, she rushed into a declamation
(she confessed) about the hardness of colonists’
hearts—who would let so deserving a couple
almost die of hunger in a land of plenty.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“As to that,” said Hubert, “very few people
suffer from hunger in Australia, except when
they decline work. Even then, they manage to
live on their friends. How did the story end?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, she formed a plan for persuading
these delightful poor to migrate to Wantabalree,
where they were to be fed and furnished
with light work. Fortunately for her peace of
mind, when she told her father and brother,
they made inquiries among the neighbours. Then
they found out that the old man was one of the
most artful and successful sheep-stealers in the
district, and had even been tried for graver crimes.
The money she gave him he invested in rum,
under the influence of which he beat his wife and
turned his little daughter out of doors.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what effect had this discovery on her
philanthropy, for of course it was old Jimmy
Doolan—a man the police have been trying to
get hold of for years—as slippery as a fox and as
savage as a wolf?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She had to recant; to admit that perhaps,
on the whole, the characters of people were
known and appreciated by those amongst whom
they lived. Still, she said there was a want of
systematic benevolence in the neighbourhood,
and that she would rather be deceived occasionally,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>than sink into a state of cold indifferentism
towards her fellow creatures.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s really quite pathetic,” said Hubert.
“One feels drawn towards a girl of such tendencies
as if she were a nice child. It seems hard that
a few years of colonial experience should deprive
her of such tender illusions.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t think anything will tone her down
into anything uninteresting, if you mean that,”
said Linda; “she has too much high principle
and refinement.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“She will learn to act judiciously in time, as
mother does, for instance,” said Laura. “She’s
always bestowing father’s substance upon some
poor creature or other; but she finds out the right
sort of people, and the proper when and where.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Before long a return visit occurred from
Wantabalree, from which place Willoughby
Dacre drove his sister to Windāhgil about a
week after the conversation above recorded.</p>

<p class='c017'>The brother and sister made their appearance
in a vehicle of unpretending appearance, being,
indeed, no other than the spring-cart which was
“given in” ostentatiously by Mr. Dealerson,
along with furniture and other station requisites.
Willoughby, having managed to rig up leading
harness, had accomplished a tandem with two
of the best-looking horses on the station, so
that the turn-out was not wholly plebeian.</p>

<p class='c017'>Much mutual delight was expressed by the
girls, and various experiences interchanged
which had occurred since their last meeting.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>The young men went off together to put up
the horses, and took advantage of the opportunity
to have a little sheep-talk.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How are you getting on so far?” said
Hubert. “Shaking down a bit, I suppose.
Does your father approve of bush life?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, he finds himself most comfortable,”
answered Willoughby. “He has a snug morning
room with a fire, and plenty of books and
papers. He says he never expected to enjoy
himself so much in the bush. He takes a great
interest in the garden too. The fruit trees and
vines are really something to look at.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t doubt it,” said Hubert. “The house
and grounds, stabling and out-offices are about
the best in the district. Well, I hope you’ll
all live there many years to enjoy them.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I hope so too,” said Willoughby; “but excuse
me if I say that you don’t seem to expect
it. Now, why is it that, as everything is so
good in its way, the sheep well-bred, everybody
says, and looking so well now, that you regard
the investment as a bad one? You are not
alone in that opinion either, though the other
neighbours don’t speak so honestly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“My prophecy of evil may not come off,
after all. This is an uncertain country as to
weather, and weather with us is everything.
But if the rain holds off, you’ll see what I mean.
You have about two-thirds too many sheep on
the run. That is all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What can we do?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>“Well, nothing just at present. In a
general way, sell off surplus stock as soon as
you can do so profitably. But in a dry season
everybody wishes to sell, and few care to buy
except at the lowest prices. However, I’ll put
you up to the likeliest dodges when the time
comes.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Thanks very much. I can’t help feeling
anxious from time to time when I think that
our all is embarked in this undertaking. I
thought it was so safe and solid, and never
dreamed that there could be such a swindle
worked when all looked fair outside. The
governor was rash, I must say. It’s a way of
his. But we must fight our way out of the
scrape, now we’re in it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s the only thing to be done, and not
to lose heart. There are always chances and
changes with stock in Australia. Fortunes are
always to be made.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And to be lost, it seems. You are just
going to invest in Queensland, I hear. Isn’t
that a long way off?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s never too far off if the country’s good,”
said Hubert. “Runs are cheap there now, but
they are always rising in value. I intend to send
a lot of our Windāhgil sheep out there as soon
as we get settled.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If we hadn’t spent all our money,” said
the young Englishman regretfully, “we
might have bought a run there too. However,
it can’t be helped, as we said before. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>shall be glad to hear from you when you get
there.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Any information I can give shall be at your
service, as well as all possible assistance,” said
Hubert, warmly. “Always depend upon that.
But it’s early in the day to talk about such
things. We shall see more clearly what to do
as the occasion arises. And now, we had better
join the ladies.”</p>

<p class='c017'>It was settled after a rather animated discussion
that the visitors were not to return to
Wantabalree that night. In vain they pleaded
household tasks, station exigencies, the anxiety
which Colonel Dacre was certain to experience
at their absence. All these reasons were treated
as mere excuses. There couldn’t be much
housekeeping for one person, especially as they
had, for a wonder, a decent cook. The station
could wait, the less work done among the sheep
at present, the better; while it was extracted in
cross-examination that Colonel Dacre had told
them that if they did not return, he should
conclude they had stayed at Windāhgil. So the
truce was definitely arranged, the horses turned
into the river paddock, the young men went out
for a drive in Hubert’s buggy to inspect a dam
“at the back,” concerning which young Dacre
had expressed some interest, while the three
girls, after a ramble in the garden, settled down
to a good steady afternoon’s needlework and an
exhaustive discussion of bush life, and Australian
matters generally.</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>“What a famous, light-running, easy trap
this is of yours!” said Dacre, as they spun over
the smooth, sandy bush track, Whalebone and
Whipcord, an exceptionally fast pair of horses,
slipping along at half-speed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes,” said Hubert. “It’s the best thing of
the kind that’s made, I believe. I bought this
to take out with me to the new country. I
think it is economical to have a vehicle of this
sort. There are many bits of station work
that a buggy comes in for, and you save horseflesh.
I wonder you don’t get one for your
sister.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, we found the tax-cart at the station,
and Rosalind’s such a terrific economist that she
wouldn’t hear of us buying a carriage, as she
calls it, for her. But I really must go in for a
buggy, if it’s only on the governor’s account.
He’s not so young as he was, and riding knocks
him about, I can see. But how fast your horses
are! I didn’t think Australian horses went in
for trotting much. None of ours do.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Australian horses (and men and women too,
as I think I have mentioned before),” remarked
Hubert with suspicious mildness, “resemble
those in other parts of the world, though the
contrary is asserted. Some are good, others
bad. Some of them—the horses, I now allude
to—can trot. Others cannot. This pair, for
instance”—(here he tightened his reins, and in
some imperceptible fashion gave a signal, which
they answered to by putting up their heads and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>bursting into sixteen miles an hour)—“can do
a mile in very fair time for non-professionals.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“So I see,” replied the young Englishman.
“I wish I was not so hasty in forming impressions;
however, I shall be cured of that in time.
But it is awfully trying to hold your tongue
when everything is new and exciting, and to
talk cautiously is foreign to the Dacre nature.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“‘<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>Experientia</em></span> does it,’ as we used to say at
school,” laughed Hubert. “You’ll be chaffing
new arrivals in a couple of years yourself. The
regulation period is about that time, and I don’t
think you’ll take so long as some people.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That’s a compliment to my general intelligence,”
said Dacre. “I suppose I ought to
feel grateful. But one can’t help a slight feeling
of soreness, you know, that after being
regularly educated for a colonial life, as I was,
and coached in all the necessary carpentering,
blacksmithing, agriculture, and so on, I should
find myself so utterly ignorant and helpless
here.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Come, come,” said Hubert; “you do yourself
injustice. It won’t take more than a year to
make a smart bushman of you, I can see. But I
suppose it’s something like going into a strange
country to hunt. You remember that when
Mr. Sawyer went to the Shires he felt under a
disadvantage at first.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, but you wouldn’t, or M’Intosh, or
any of the other fellows I’ve seen; that’s what
makes me so savage with myself. You’d know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>your way about; people wouldn’t discover,
unless you told them, that you had lived in
England all your days, while we fellows, who
came out here certainly thinking ourselves as
good all round as any one we were likely to find,
are always exposing our ignorance, getting
laughed at, or taken in, and are marked for
immigrants and tyros as far as we can be seen.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I observe your point, and it is a little aggravating,”
replied Hubert. “But after all,
it is a compliment to our mother country that
we make it our business from childhood to
know all about her history and traditions,
manners and customs, from a thousand accurate
chronicles. Our usages, modelled upon hers
and religiously handed down by our parents,
are identical, or as nearly so as we can make
them. But our country and our trifling yet
marked departures from English standards have
found few close observers, accurate descriptions,
and fewer narrators still. There is hardly any
way of getting acquainted with us, except by
actual experience.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It looks like it,” assented his friend, reluctantly;
“but I mourn over the fond illusions
Rosalind and I are doomed to lose before we
complete our apprenticeship. Hope we may
acquire others not less satisfactory. The outlook
at Wantabalree at present might be
brighter too, if what you told my father comes
to pass.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It may not happen after all, or it may be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>parried and averted. All manner of chances
may arise in your interest. So do not <em>think</em>
of desponding,” said Hubert. “One of the
special characteristics of Australians is, that they
<em>never despair</em>.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Never know when they are beat, in fact,”
said Dacre, with a returning smile. “Well
that is a genuine English trait at any rate, so
I must support the credit of my country.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>The dam was inspected and the principle of
the “by-wash” explained to Dacre, who showed
an aptitude and readiness to comprehend the
necessary detail which favourably impressed
Hubert.</p>

<p class='c017'>The free horses pulled more on the homeward
track than coming out, and elicited high
commendation.</p>

<p class='c017'>“They certainly are superb goers, and this is
the poetry of motion,” Dacre exclaimed, as,
sending out their eight legs as if they belonged
to one horse, the well-matched pair made the
light, yet strong vehicle spin over the level road
with an ease and velocity which no two-wheeled
trap ever approached. “I shall be unhappy
till I set up a buggy and a pair of trotters—all
the good resolutions to spend nothing that
could be helped made at the beginning of the
month notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s false economy to go without a buggy,”
said Hubert. “Tell your father I said so.
And that is easily demonstrable. It saves horse-flesh,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>enables you to carry feed in a dry season,
and has other useful and agreeable qualities.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The tea, for which they were just in time to
dress, was an agreeable, not to say hilarious,
meal. The Miss Stamfords, it would seem, had
been admitting their visitor into all kinds of
occult mysteries of domestic management.
How they arranged when they were short of a
servant, without a cook or a housemaid, or
indeed, as occasionally happened, though not
for any protracted period, when they had no
servant at all.</p>

<p class='c017'>Miss Dacre was astonished to find what a
complete and practical knowledge these soft-appearing,
graceful damsels displayed with
many branches of household lore, and how many
hints they were able to offer for her acceptance,
all of which tended to lighten the labours of
bush housekeeping, which she had already found
burdensome.</p>

<p class='c017'>From Mrs. Stamford, on opening the relief
question, it was discovered that she had various
humble friends and pensioners, all of whom she
helped, after a fashion which encouraged them to
be industrious and self-supporting; others again
received advice in the management of their
families, the treatment of their children, the
choice of trades for their sons, and of service
for their daughters. In a number of humble
homes, and by all the neighbouring settlers,
this gentle, low-voiced woman was regarded as
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>châtelaine</em></span> of the manor, the good angel of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>the neighbourhood, the personage to whom all
deferred, whose virtues all imitated at a distance,
and whom to disappoint or to pain was a matter
more deeply regretted than the actual shortcoming
which had led to reproof.</p>

<p class='c017'>And all this work had been done—this
sensible system of true Christian benevolence
and aid was in full flow and operation—without
one word being said by the agents themselves
which gave a hint of the energy, contrivance,
and self-denial manifestly necessary for such
results. All things were done silently, unobtrusively;
no one spoke of them, or seemed to
think them other than matters of course.</p>

<p class='c017'>This was a phase of colonial life which struck
the eager critic of the new land with something
like dismay. Was it possible in this strange
country that there might be yet other instances
of human love and charity efficiently performed
with equal thoroughness and absence of demonstration?
If so, had she not been making
herself somewhat ridiculous in assuming
hurriedly that there were so many niches in
Australian temples sacred to heroic effort which
were unfilled before she arrived.</p>

<p class='c017'>In spite of the slight feeling of soreness
which the knowledge caused her, the general
influence of the symposium, separated as she
had been for some weeks from companions of
her own sex and social standing, was unusually
exhilarating. Her naturally genial temperament
led her, therefore, to laugh secretly at her own
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>miscalculation and discomfiture as a very good
and choice joke indeed.</p>

<p class='c017'>However, she was less explanatory than her
brother had been, preferring inferential admission,
after the manner of her sex. This concession
to the wisdom of the colonists exhibited itself
in unaffected good humour and affectionate
cordiality towards her comparatively recent
friends.</p>

<p class='c017'>She joined cheerily in all the amusements and
occupations of the evening. She sang and
played, praising the performances of the
Stamford girls and the new songs they had
brought back with them from the metropolis.
She talked flowers and greenhouse with her
hostess, and had a slight political tilt with Mr.
Stamford. In all these subjects she exhibited
sound teaching as well as a careful theoretical
training. Nothing could be more modest
and less assertive than her general manner, at
the same time that a wider range of thought,
consequent upon European travel and extended
social experience, was unconsciously apparent.
When the Windāhgil family retired for the
night, Mr. Stamford expressed his opinion to
his wife, in the sanctity of the matrimonial
chamber, that he had never met a finer girl in
his life before, and that he was delighted that
they should have such a neighbour; while
Hubert, in the smoking-room, whither he had
retired with his young friend at a late period of
the evening, <em>may have</em> meditated upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>command “to love thy neighbour as thyself,”
but forbore to commit himself by unguarded
expression.</p>

<p class='c017'>On the next day, after a mirthful and
consolatory breakfast—a trifle later than usual,
inasmuch as the three maidens sat talking so
late that the morning slumbers were prolonged—the
new neighbours departed. Fresh expressions
of approval and surprise were exhibited
by this English guest at the home-baked
bread, the butter, the honey, the incomparable
home-cured bacon, and other triumphs of
domestic economy.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have enjoyed myself as I never expected
to do in the bush,” she said; “I thought there
would be nothing but devotion to ‘duty, stern
daughter of the voice of God.’ I never
dreamed that so much of the poetry of life
was attainable. You have taught me a lesson”
(this was in confidence to Laura at parting)
“for which I shall be all the better henceforth.
I am not too old or too conceited to learn, at
any rate.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have nothing very much to learn,” replied
Laura; “we may be mutually advantageous
to one another, that’s all, if we make an agreement
to put as much friendship and as little ceremony
into our intercourse as possible. It will not be
long before we come over to stay a night at
Wantabalree, before poor Hubert starts for
Queensland, I grieve to say, and then you must
comfort us in our loneliness.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>“Papa will be quite charmed to see you
again. If you had heard all the fine things he
said about you and Linda, you would have
thought he was looking out for a step-mamma
for me. But he is purely theoretical in that
department, I am thankful to say, and now
good bye, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>au revoir</em></span>!”</p>

<p class='c017'>The promised visit was paid, and a renewal
of friendship and good offices ratified, while the
days passed on and the period of Hubert’s stay
with his family drew near to a close. The
long-expected, long-dreaded day arrived for his
departure to the land of adventure, and, alas!
of danger—it could not be concealed.</p>

<p class='c017'>All preparations for the momentous event
were at length completed, and once more the
family assembled at the railway terminus at
Mooramah to bid farewell to the son and
brother—the mainstay, the hope of Windāhgil.
Deep and unaffected was the grief, although
outward manifestations were heroically suppressed.</p>

<p class='c017'>The warning bell sounded, the last adieux
were said, and, as the train moved off, relentless,
irrevocable as fate—the fair summer day
gloomed, while the family party drove sadly
back to their home, from which the sunshine
seemed to have been suddenly withdrawn.</p>

<p class='c017'>Such are the partings in this world of
chequered joy and sorrow—of light and shadow.
What prayers were that night offered up to the
All-wise Dispenser of events for the safety, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>success, the return—ah, me!—of the absent
wayfarer—for him might the fervid sunbeams of
the inner deserts—be tempered—for him might
the fierce denizens of the wild be placated—for
him might the terrible uncertainty of flood and
field be guided for good! The sisters wept
themselves to sleep in each other’s arms, while
the mother’s face was sad with unuttered grief,
and the father’s brow grave for many a day
after this long-remembered parting.</p>

<p class='c017'>But Time, the healer, brought to them, as to
others, the successive stages of calm resignation,
of renewed hope. The post brought tidings of
a safely concluded voyage, of accomplished land
travel. At longer intervals, of promising investment,
of successful exploration, of permanent
settlement in the land of promise, of
the occupation of pastures new in a region richly
gifted by nature, and needing but the gradual
advance of civilisation to be promoted to a
profitable and acknowledged status.</p>

<p class='c017'>Lastly, a despatch arrived of an eminently
satisfactory nature, from Mr. Barrington Hope,
confirming the latest advices from “the wandering
heir.” “Mr. Hubert Stamford had
more than justified all the expectations formed
of his energy and business aptitude. He had
purchased, at a comparatively small outlay,
a lightly-stocked and very extensive station
upon the border of the settled country. Leaving
Mr. Delamere and a manager of proved
ability in charge, he had pushed on, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>after a toilsome journey, happily accomplished
without accident or loss, had discovered and
taken up, under the Queensland regulations,
which are most favourable to pioneers, an
immense tract of well-watered, pastoral country
of the best quality. They had received from
their correspondents the highest commendation
of the value of the property now secured and
registered in the name of Delamere and
Stamford. Windāhgil Downs was a proverb in
the mouths of the pioneer squatters of the
colony, and the Laura and Linda rivers were
duly marked upon the official map at the
Surveyor-General’s office as permanent and
important watercourses.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The Austral Agency Company had the
fullest confidence in the prospects of the firm,
and any reasonable amount of capital would
be forthcoming for necessary expenses in stocking
up and legally occupying the magnificent
tract of pastoral country referred to.”</p>

<p class='c017'>A private letter accompanied this formally-worded
official communication, informing Mr.
and Mrs. Stamford that the writer proposed
to avail himself of their kind invitation to
visit Windāhgil at Christmas, when he would be
enabled to utilise a long-promised leave of absence
for a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c017'>It may be imagined, but can with difficulty be
even sketched faintly, with what feelings of joy
and gratitude this precious intelligence was
received at Windāhgil; the happiness, too
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>deep for words, of the parents; the wild,
ecstatic triumph of the sisters; the elation of
the servants and station hands, which communicated
itself to the inhabitants of the surrounding
sub-district, all of whom were included in the
general glory of the event and unfeignedly
happy at the news of Hubert’s brilliant success.</p>

<p class='c017'>“He deserves it all. I never thought but
he’d come to good, and show ’em all the way if
he got a chance,” was the general comment of
the humbler partisans. “He was always the
poor man’s friend, was Master Hubert; and now
he’s going to be at the top of the tree, and it’s
where he ought to be. He’s a good sort, and
always was. There wasn’t a young man within
a day’s ride of Mooramah as was fit to be named
in the same day with him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! Laura, isn’t it splendid, delicious,
divine?” exclaimed Linda, dancing round her
sister and mother with inexpressible delight.
(Mr. Stamford had retired to compose his feelings
in the garden.) “Oh! dear, this world’s
a splendid place of abode, after all, though I’ve
had terrible doubts lately. Wasn’t it fortunate
we had strength of mind to let dear, darling
Hubert go, though it nearly broke our hearts?
I was certain some of my heart-strings cracked—really
I was—but now I feel better than ever,
quite <em>young</em>, indeed! Oh! how grateful we
ought to be!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You were not the only one who suffered,
were you, dear?” said Laura, looking dreamily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>into the distance, beyond the gleaming river,
now indeed reduced to nearly its old dimensions.
“Our prayer has been answered. Some
day we shall see our hero returning ‘bringing
his sheaves with him.’ Oh! happy day! Mother,
what shall we do to relieve our feelings? I
feel as if I could not bear it unless we did something.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Suppose we drive over to Wantabalree?”
suggested Linda. “Father always enjoys a chat
with the Colonel, and that dear, good Rosalind is
always so nice and sympathising about Hubert.
I wonder if she cares for him the <em>least little</em> bit?
But she’d die before she let anybody know, and
Hubert was so disagreeable, he refused to give
me the least hint. What do you think, mother?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think nothing at all, my dear child. In
all these matters, it is the wisest course neither
to think nor to speak prematurely. But I
daresay your father would drive us over, if we
asked him, and we could stay a night there. As
you say, a chat with the Colonel always does
him good.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>So at Windāhgil and Wantabalree the calm,
uneventful bush life went on as usual. That
life so peaceful, so wholesome for the spirit, so
chiefly free from the sharp cares and anxieties of
city existence—where the eye is refreshed daily
with nature pictures, at once grand and consoling.
The early morn, so fair and fresh, when the sun
first glorifies the pale mists of dawn, changing
all the Orient with magic suddenness to opaline
hues and golden flame. The green gloom, the
august solitude of the boundless forest, the glowing
sunshine which pierces even its inmost recesses
at midday; the wavering shadows, born
of the inconstant breeze; the tender eve when
a solemn hush falls alike on stream and valley,
on mountain-side or wildwood glade, and all the
ancient majesty of night awes the senses. For
the Windāhgil family, the placid days came and
went, lightened, as of old, by the regularity of
customary home duties, by books and music, by
walks along the rippling river, by rides and
drives through the winding forest paths. Occasional
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>expeditions to Wantabalree made salutary
change for all. As the summer months wore
on—as the days lengthened, and the mid-day
heat became intense; as the fiercer sun rays
commenced to wither the bush herbage of the
river meadows, the many-hued wild flowers of
heath and hill; as the watercourses, fed by
spring showers, commenced to trickle faintly—there
was a tendency to complain of the tyrant
Summer, and yet to long for the Christmas-tide
as a period of mirth and enjoyment—this year
invested with a special charm.</p>

<p class='c017'>For had not a telegram from some unknown,
unknowable place, and costing quite a small
fortune, arrived, which stated that Hubert,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bien aimé</em></span>, would return at Christmas—actually
return? “Like the prodigal,” as Linda
said, “only that it was the reverse in everything
except the coincidence of its being ‘from a far
country.’”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The coincidence being so very slight, Linda,”
said her mother, “perhaps it would have been
as well to refrain from Scriptural parallel altogether.
Don’t you think so, Miss Dacre? I
had given up expecting him after his last letter,
in which he said there were insuperable difficulties
in the way.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He has managed to surmount the insuperable
apparently,” said Linda. “Hubert always
was a wonderful boy for accomplishing things
just at the last moment. I don’t think I ever
knew him beaten by anything he made up his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>mind to do, though he used to leave things
rather too long.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That is one of Hubert’s worst points—or
rather, most pronounced weaknesses,” said
Laura; “he won’t be wise in time except on
what he thinks are occasions of importance. It
seems a defect with people of energy and resource.
For instance, I can’t imagine Hubert
saying he will cross a river or accomplish a
journey and failing to carry out his purpose,
whatever happened. He is one of those people
who seem made for difficulties.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But difficulties which come upon the unprepared
are apt to be disastrous,” said Miss
Dacre; “for my part, I am strongly in favour
of taking every imaginable precaution before
the time of need.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The principle is good, but it doesn’t apply
to Hubert,” said Linda, still unconvinced.
“Difficulties and impossibilities only stimulate
his resources, which are innumerable. When
another man would lie down and die, he
would be quite in his element, ordering, inventing,
combining, and finally pulling through
triumphantly.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It must be interesting to watch such a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>tour
de force</em></span>,” said Miss Dacre; “but I prefer the
generalship which surveys the field, and places
the battle in advance. Hit or miss, conquerors
find their Moscow some day.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hubert has made a glorious campaign this
time,” said Laura. “What a day of days it will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>be when he shows his brown face at Mooramah
again! Doesn’t it seem an age since he went
away, Rosalind?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am sure papa and Willoughby will be
very glad to see him again,” said she. “I
know they wish to have his advice about the
sheep and the season. They are getting quite
anxious.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>No! The engine did not break down. The
steamer with the Chinese name, from the far
north, the <em>Ly-wang-foo</em>, did not founder or take
fire. The floods did not sweep away the railway
bridges. There was not even an earthquake.
All these phenomena and abnormal occurrences
were, in Linda’s opinion, almost certain to
happen because Hubert was coming home to
spend Christmas with the family, and envious
Fate would be certain to interfere. Everything
had gone so prosperously hitherto that Destiny
must be propitiated by sacrifice. Mr. Barrington
Hope was coming up also, as he had looked
forward to a holiday—of course <em>he</em> would be
disappointed, and so on.</p>

<p class='c017'>Wonderful to relate, a few days before Christmas,
again the family trap was in requisition,
driven by one of the boys.</p>

<p class='c017'>The door of the first-class carriage
opened, and a bronzed, Indian-officer-looking
man stepped out. The boys at first did not
know him. But when a tall, broad-shouldered
gentleman, who followed him, proposed to send
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>a porter for their luggage, the younger boy
shouted out—“Why, it’s Hubert! Hubert!
What a lark! We didn’t know him. Why
you <em>have</em> changed! You’re ever so much
thinner, and your eyes are larger, and your face
browner. What have you done to yourself?
We’ve come for you and Mr. Hope. Is this
him?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, this is he, Master Maurice. Your
grammar appears to have stood still, though you
have grown such a big fellow. See about the
luggage, and have it put in the buggy; it will
hold it all, unless it has got smaller. Well,
how are mother and father and Laura, and
Linda, and Waterking, and everybody? Why
didn’t they come?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well—they thought they’d be hugging you
before all the people, and they’d better wait and
do it at home. So they sent me and Val with
the buggy. You’d better drive.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That is my intention, Maurice. I prefer to
drive, though I know you can handle the reins.
But tell me about Windāhgil. What is the
grass like? Had much rain?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Only enough for sprinkling the garden
these three months. I heard old Jerry, the
shepherd, tell Paddy Nolan that he thought it
was going to set in dry—the west wind was
always blowing. <em>We’ve</em> lots of feed yet.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Old Jerry is a good judge of the weather at
Mooramah; he’s been watching it these fifty
years. And how are they at Wantabalree?”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>“Very poor, almost starving.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What?” said Hubert. And then laughing
at the boy’s strictly pastoral ideas, he said—“You
mean the sheep in the paddocks, I
suppose.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, of course; they’re getting as bare as
your hand. What they’ll do with all those
sheep in another month or two nobody knows.
Half of ’em’ll die before winter.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You seem to take a practical view of
things, Maurice,” said Mr. Hope. “Are matters
as bad as all that?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, I’m about a good deal, and I can’t
help seeing. It’s a pity, too; they’re so nice, all
of them.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Hubert at home again! After all the doubts,
fears, delays. Maurice had not exaggerated the
amount of hugging, as he disrespectfully expressed
it, which the returning hero had to
undergo, and which would probably have created
a stoppage on Mooramah platform. Mr. Hope
stood by with a tolerant air, and even made
some light remark to Miss Dacre as to their
being left out of the extremely warm greetings
which prevailed. A very short time, however,
was suffered to elapse before all due apologies
were made to their guests, and the cordiality of
Laura’s manner perhaps caused Barrington
Hope to overlook any overweening measure of
love bestowed upon the long-absent brother.</p>

<p class='c017'>“How her eyes sparkled, how her cheek
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>glowed, how she seemed to devour the young
fellow with her eyes!” he said to himself. And
he argued favourably, knowing something of
womankind, of the probable devotion to her
husband should she ever condescend to endow
mortal man with that supreme and sacred
title.</p>

<p class='c017'>It was in vain to expect much general conversation
that day. If the visitors had been less
sympathetic persons they might easily have been
aggrieved at the predominance of Hubert’s
personal adventures, opinions and experiences in
all subsequent intercourse.</p>

<p class='c017'>For the moment, everybody thought him
much altered and changed, wasted even in
frame, sunburned, blackened by exposure, but,
on the whole, improved. There was a determination
in his expression which had not so
habitually marked his features before—a look as
of a man who has confronted the grim hazards
of the waste—who has dared the odds which in
the desert land of the savage are arrayed against
him; dared them only to conquer. It was the
face of the conscript after the campaign and
the battle-field. If there was less than the old
measure of schoolboy gaiety and frolicsome
spirits, there was an added infusion of the
dignity of the man.</p>

<p class='c017'>Then his adventures. He must relate some
of them. Even Miss Dacre joined in this
request. Like the knife-grinder, “story he had
none to tell,” but could not escape owning to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>having been laid up in a bark hut with fever and
ague, that had pulled him down so; nearly
drowned in crossing a flooded river; had a
brush with the blacks, who rose up from the
tall grass all round him; horse speared under
him, and so on. All this, though Hubert made
light of it with characteristic modesty, seemed
to his hearers of the nature of thrilling and
exciting romance.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hubert must feel like a troubadour of the
Middle Ages,” said Linda, “reciting before the
lady of the castle and her maidens. It must
have been an awful temptation to improvise
situations, and I dare say they did. Fancy if we
had no books, and were dependent entirely upon
wandering minstrels!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It mightn’t be altogether such a bad thing,
Miss Linda,” said Barrington Hope. “A
handsome young troubadour would be more
entertaining than a dry book, or even an
indifferent novel.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It wouldn’t be such a bad trade for the
unemployed,” said Laura; “but I suspect
neither their manners nor their education would
be found suitable.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Some of the swagmen in Queensland would
fill the requirements so far,” said Hubert. “I
have seen more than one ‘honourable’ on the
tramp. Only it would not do to trust them
too near the sideboard.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a pathetic picture,” said Miss Dacre;
“fancy the son of a peer trudging along the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>road, with his knapsack on his back, actually
begging from door to door!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is not regarded as begging in outside
country,” said Hubert. “It is the recognised
mode of locomotion for labourers and artisans.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And can they not procure steady employment?”
said Miss Dacre, in a tone of deep
anxiety. “Surely it only needs some one to take
an interest in them, and give them good advice.
Now, don’t smile in that provoking way, Mr.
Stamford, or I shall think you have brought
back unimpaired one of your least amiable
traits.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Forgive me, Miss Dacre, for presuming on
my part to hint that you do not appear to
be cured of what I supposed you would have
learned by this time to distrust—an unlimited
trust in your less favoured fellow creatures.
The men of whom I speak live at free quarters
when they travel, are occasionally received on
equal terms, and are paid, when they condescend
to do work, at the ordinary high rate of wages,
viz., from thirty shillings to two pounds per
week, with board and lodging.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And are they not encouraged to save this?
They could soon put by quite a small fortune.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Their misfortune is that they never <em>do</em> save.
They invariably gamble or drink—generally the
latter—till all is gone. Once lapsed, they follow
the habits of the uneducated working man with
curious fidelity.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a terrible condition! What a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>terrible country where such things can take
place!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“On the contrary; it is the best land attainable
by the confirmed prodigal. In England,
I take it, the dissipated, improvident men of
their order go rapidly and thoroughly to the
bad, passing swiftly out of knowledge. Here
they have intervals of wholesome labour and
compulsory sobriety, which recruit the constitution
and give them opportunity for repentance,
if they ever <em>do</em> repent.”</p>

<p class='c017'>While this conversation was proceeding, Mr.
Stamford and Barrington Hope had been having
a quiet semi-business talk, and this being concluded,
Miss Dacre was persuaded to open the
piano, after which Mr. Hope gave them some
of the latest <cite>Parsifal</cite> morceaux fresh from
Bayreuth, where he had a musical correspondent,
having spent there some of the days of his
youth. Music now absorbed all attention for
the rest of the evening, everybody being more
or less of an amateur; and even Hubert showing
that he had not been wholly without the
region of sweet sounds by bringing back and
displaying two new songs.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Who played the accompaniments for you,
Hubert?” said Linda. “Somebody did, or
you couldn’t have learnt them so well.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Do you suppose there are no ladies in the
‘Never-Never’ country?” said he. “Quite a
mistake. People of culture abound.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The next day was adjudged by common consent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>to be spent at Wantabalree. Miss Dacre
was anxious to get home, and would by no
means consent to stay another day at Windāhgil.
Mr. Hope thought he would like to see Wantabalree,
of which celebrated station he had heard
so much, and to pay his respects to the Colonel.
So it was arranged that Hubert should drive
Miss Dacre and Linda, while Laura went under
Mr. Hope’s guidance in the Windāhgil trap.
Mr. and Mrs. Stamford elected to stay at home
to take care of the house, and talk quietly over
Hubert’s return, personal appearance, prospects,
and generally interesting belongings.</p>

<p class='c017'>Arrived at Wantabalree, the Colonel met
them with his usual courteous and hospitable
manner. He congratulated Hubert on his safe
return from Queensland, and hoped he had not
taken up all the good country, as it seemed to
him that other people would have to migrate, if
the season did not improve.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not for another year or two, Colonel, at
any rate,” said Hubert, cheerily; “you’ve
plenty of water here, and Willoughby must
do a little ‘travelling’; anything’s better than
throwing up the sponge.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I see little else for it,” said the Colonel,
who had come to wear an anxious expression.
Miss Dacre grew grave as she marked her
father’s face, but she controlled herself with an
effort, as it seemed to Hubert, and telling Linda
to go into the drawing-room and admire her
flowers, followed her guests. The men remained
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>outside and lounged into the stable yard,
where the horses and traps were being arranged,
looking about them, and chatting on indifferent
subjects before going to the house.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a pretty situation you have here!”
said Hope. “The accomplished Mr. Dealerson,
of whom I have heard so much, must have been
a man of taste. How picturesquely the creek
winds round the point near that splendid willow;
the elevation is just sufficient, and the flat seems
made on purpose for a few fields and the fruit-garden.
The view of the distant mountain-range
completes the landscape. Capital stabling
too.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! confound him!” growled Willoughby;
“he was sharp enough to see that a smart
homestead like this was just the thing to catch
‘new-chum’ buyers. It’s not bad in its way,
but I hate the whole thing so, when I think of
the price we shall have to pay for it, that I
could burn the house down with pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t know so much about that,” said
Hope; “it doesn’t do to be hasty in realising
in stock matters any more than in purchasing.
You and Hubert had better have a good talk
over accounts before I leave, and if he can
suggest anything, perhaps we may manage to
tide over for a while. He’s quite a rising man
of business, I assure you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish to heaven the governor had remained
in Sydney with my sister, and sent me out to
Queensland with him,” said the young man;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>“but it’s too late to think of that now. We
must make the best of it. But I won’t stand
grumbling here all day, Mr. Hope. Come in
and we’ll see if there’s any lunch to be had.
‘Sufficient for the day,’ and so on?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert had found his way into the drawing-room
before this colloquy had ended, and was
looking over a collection of Venetian photographs
which Miss Dacre had collected during
their last visit to that city of the sea.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wonder if I shall ever see the Lion of St.
Mark again?” she said. “I feel as if we were
in another planet.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is difficult to say where we shall all be in
a few years’ time,“ said Hubert. ”<em>I</em> am not
going to stay here all my life. But you won’t
run away from Australia just yet, Miss Dacre?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should think not,” she replied, cheerfully;
“matters don’t look like it at present. The
doubt in my mind is whether we shall ever be
able to leave it. I don’t say that I am dissatisfied,
but I should like to see the Old World
again before I die.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“When Willoughby has made his fortune, or
other things come to pass, you will be able to
go home and do all sorts of fascinating travel,”
said Hubert. “We must look forward.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I feel certain you are not laughing at me,
Mr. Stamford,” she said, fixing her eyes upon
him with a wistful expression; “but if I did
not know you so well I should suspect it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nothing, of course, is farther from my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>thoughts,” said the young man, meeting the
gaze with equal directness; “but I really see
no reason to doubt your seeing Europe within
the next five years, so many changes take place
in this Australian world of ours.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Hardly such a change as that,” she replied,
smiling apparently at the absurdity of the idea;
“and now I think I hear the luncheon bell.
You must have thought I meant to starve you
all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>That no intention of this kind had actuated
the fair hostess was made apparent as they were
ushered into the dining-room, a large and
handsome apartment wherein the furniture and
appointments were in keeping with the general
plan of the house. Everybody was in capital
spirits; youth and hope were in the ascendant
in the majority of the party, and as their conversation
became general, everybody seemed as
joyous as if Wantabalree were the best paying
and the most fortunate station in the district.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a lovely place this is altogether!”
said Linda. “Mr. Dealerson must have had
some good in him after all. If father and
Hubert had not been so prejudiced against him,
he might have married and settled in the district.
I believe he’s not so bad-looking.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I should never have come to see you, for
one,” said Hubert, “if you had been the lucky
girl that carried off such a prize. But I should
like to have condemned him to work out this
place, with its present stock, in a dry season;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>that would have been a truly appropriate punishment
for his iniquities. The ancients used to
think of fitting fellows in another world in their
own line. But this savours of shop. Willoughby,
did you get any snipe this spring?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Made two or three capital bags, but they
went off as soon as the weather got dry. Hares
are getting plentiful too, and I was going to get
up a couple of greyhounds, but all that sort of
thing’s knocked on the head now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! nonsense; you mustn’t give up your
shooting. ‘Never allow your business to interfere
with your pleasure’; we have little enough
recreation in Australia. You should have
seen the brown quail in the Mitchell grass in our
new country. I used to put up bevies of them
looking like partridges. I must take some
setters up next time.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Isn’t the heat very dreadful up there?”
inquired Miss Dacre.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Rather tropical,” said Hubert; “but there
is a freshness in the air that carries you through.
The mosquitoes and sandflies, are perhaps the
worst evils. But with a good pisé house, which
you could shut up and keep cool, they might be
greatly reduced.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then the blacks; they seem nearly as bad
as the North American Indians?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Not quite. I suspect ‘Sitting Bull’ or
‘Red Cloud’ would have given us a deal more
trouble. Not but what we have to be careful.
The best way, I find, is to treat them with perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>justice, to keep your word with them for
good or evil. They learn to respect you in the
end. After a while we shall have no trouble
with them.”</p>

<p class='c017'>During the afternoon, which was devoted to
nothing in particular, a very agreeable arrangement
which leaves guests at liberty to amuse
themselves as they feel inclined, Hubert found
himself in Miss Dacre’s company at the end of
the lower walk of the orchard which followed
the winding bank of the creek.</p>

<p class='c017'>The bank was high at this particular spot,
having been partially worn away by flood waters,
leaving a wide, low shore at the opposite side.
A deep pool had been formed, which now
gleamed and sparkled in the lowered sun
rays. A grand weeping-willow, self-planted,
perhaps, in the earliest days of the occupation
of the station, shaded it with trailing green
streamers.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Wantabalree is certainly the show station of
the district,” said Hubert. “You were fortunate
in some respects in having so pleasant a
home in which to make your first Australian
experiences.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have been very happy here,” said she;
“but that will make it all the more painful to
leave, as I fear we shall be obliged to do at no
distant period. I do not so much care for my
own sake, but it will be discouraging to
Willoughby, and my father is certain to feel
the change more than any of us.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>“Matters look bad, and we are going to
have another dry season, I believe,” replied
Hubert. “I don’t like these westerly winds,
and clouds coming up without rain. Still there
is hope.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“But had we not a drought two years before—just
before my father made this purchase?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Quite true, but of late years, unfortunately,
that has been no reason why another should not
follow in quick succession. It is rather unfair of
<em>Madre Natura</em>, but there is no help for it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what shall you do at Windāhgil, for I
suppose we shall all be in the same boat?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall persuade my father to start every
sheep he has, with the exception of the best
flock, for my new country. The Wantabalree
sheep had better take the road too. I must
have a talk to Willoughby.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh, I do so wish you would, Mr. Stamford.
I am sure he and papa are growing very troubled
about our prospects. Willoughby and I can
bear all that may come, but it will be a terrible
blow to poor papa.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Miss Dacre, if you will permit me to confide
in you—I have been concocting a little plot.
If carried out it may—I say only it may—perhaps
serve to improve the aspect of things.
If you thought the Colonel would like to
consult with me and Willoughby about the
coming difficulty, I should be very glad to
make the attempt.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Nothing would give my father more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>pleasure, and, indeed, tend to relieve his mind.
I feel certain he has been anxious to consult
you, Mr. Stamford, but hardly likes to begin
the subject.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We must have a council of war then,
which will include Mr. Barrington Hope.
He is a tower of strength, as I know by experience,
and it’s a piece of luck his being here
now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We should be grateful to you all the days
of our lives, you may be sure, whatever happens,
for the interest you have always shown in our
welfare. If your advice had been taken in the
first instance, all would have been well.” And
here the young lady looked at Hubert with such
an approving expression of countenance, that
he felt as if he could throw up the new country
and devote himself to the Sisyphean task of
getting Wantabalree out of debt, if only she
would promise to repay him by an occasional
smile such as this one, the memory of which he
felt certain would haunt him for an indefinite
period.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I can’t, of course, guarantee success, but
I think I see my way towards lightening the
ship and getting steerage way on her.” This
nautical simile had probably been derived from
his late maritime experiences, and was, perhaps,
not altogether appropriate; but Miss Dacre
was evidently not by any means in a critical
frame of mind, for she again looked approvingly
at him, and then led the way to the verandah,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>where Laura and Willoughby, Mr. Hope and
Linda, were apparently having such an animated
conversation that they seemed to be trying who
could make the most noise.</p>

<p class='c017'>The principal contention was whether a town
or country life was the more wholesome and
enjoyable. Laura and Willoughby were in
favour of rural felicity, while Linda and Mr.
Hope brought all the arguments they could
think of in favour of cities—greater stimulation
of the intellect, removal of prejudice, leaning
towards altruism; in fact, higher general development
of the individual. When Miss
Dacre arrived, she, being appealed to, in the
capacity of referee, unhesitatingly gave her
decision in favour of a country life, stating her
arguments so clearly that she completely turned
the scale, besides causing Hubert the keenest
enjoyment by, as he supposed, thus laying bare
her own predilections.</p>

<p class='c017'>After this contest of wits the Colonel appeared
on the scene, having returned from his
usual afternoon’s ride; and Hubert, with some
address, managed to interest him in a discussion
on station management, and the probable profits
of agriculture, listening with deference to his
senior’s ideas and suggestions.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Before the Windāhgil party returned on
the following day a council of war was held,
at the conclusion of which the Colonel’s face
assumed a very different expression from that
which it habitually wore. The four men met
in his study, where the accounts, assets, and
liabilities were laid before the financial authority,
who scanned them with keen and practised
eye.</p>

<p class='c017'>After what appeared to the others, and
especially to Willoughby and his father, an
astonishingly short examination, he raised his
head and asked these pertinent questions: “I
see your next bill, £12,437 14<em>s.</em> 10<em>d.</em>, falls due
in March,” he said. “After that, there is
nothing more to be met but station expenses
for another year, against which there will, of
course, be the wool clip. You have 54,786
sheep, more or less, on the run. Is that so?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Half of which are to die this winter,
Hubert says. Oh, yes—they’re all in the
paddocks,” replied the younger Dacre, in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>tone of reckless despair, while the Colonel’s
face set with steadfast resolve, yet showed by
the twitching of his lips how severe was the
repression of feeling—how tense the strain of
anxiety.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Never mind about that just yet,” said
Barrington Hope. “We’ll see into the available
assets first. About this next bill, Colonel;
how do you propose to meet it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“By the sale of sheep, I suppose. There is
no other way. And if this drought comes to
pass I am informed they will be next to valueless.
How is the next one—of equal amount,
and another still, to be paid? In such a case
I see nothing but ruin staring me in the face.
Good God! that I should have brought my
poor children to such a pass!”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here the brave soldier, who had fought with
cheerful courage on more than one battle-field,
when comrades lay dead and dying around him—who
had been the first man across the breach
when the rebel artillery were mowing down his
regiment like swathes of meadow grass at Delhi,
appeared quite unmanned.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It will never do to give up the fight before
the end of the day, Colonel,” said Mr. Hope,
gently. “As a military man, you must know
that reserves may come up at any moment. I
will promise to give you a decided answer at the
end of our colloquy. But we must move
according to the rules of war.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You must pardon me, my dear sir,” said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the Colonel, with a faint smile. “I trust not
to embarrass the court again; but the fact is, I
am a child in commercial affairs, and the probable
loss of my children’s whole fortune touches
me too acutely.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Have <em>you</em> any advice to offer, Hubert?”
queried Hope. “I understand we are all here
on terms of friendly equality.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Yes, I have,” said the young man, with an
air of decision. “You can judge of its value.
All the Windāhgil sheep, with the exception of
a couple of flocks of studs, start for our Queensland
country in January. The dry belt likely
to be affected by the coming drought is a narrow
one not more than two hundred miles wide, and
as the sheep are fairly strong now, though they
won’t remain so, they should cross that with
trifling loss. Donald Greenhaugh, a first-class
man, has agreed to go in charge. Sheep are
sheep over there now for stocking up new
country, and we can sell to advantage what we
do not want for Windāhgil Downs. The larger
the number sent in one overland journey like
this, the smaller the expense of droving per
head. I propose that Wantabalree should be
cleared in the same way. Willoughby can go
in charge of his own sheep, and we can share
the expense.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I see nothing to prevent your idea from
being carried out,” said Mr. Hope. “I am
aware that sheep of good quality, as the Wantabalree
sheep proverbially are, are scarce, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>saleable at high rates, in the new country. The
main thing will be to have a first-class road
overseer.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Greenhaugh has been out with an exploring
party over all that country,” said Hubert;
“and as a head drover is worth his weight in
gold. A sober, steady fellow, too, and a good
hand with men. No better bushman anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m ready to start next week,” said
Willoughby, with the fire of ardent youth in
his kindling eye. “I never expected to have
such a chance. But—” and here his face
became grave and thoughtful—“what do you
say, father? Will you and Rosalind be able
to get on without me?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We must try, my boy. The time will
pass heavily, I doubt not; but,” and here he
walked over to Hubert, and put his hand on
his firm shoulder, “your father did not grudge
you in the path of honourable ambition, nor
can I be more selfish. God bless you both, my
boys! and bring you safe back once more to
gladden our hearts. It seems to me as if
Providence had decided this issue, and that I
have little hand in it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish now to understand, Colonel Dacre,”
said Hope; “if, upon their arrival in Queensland,
you will place 20,000 sheep in our hands
for sale—at such prices as may be then ruling—and
whether by the terms of your mortgage to
Mr. Dealerson—who has of course, taken care
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>to tie you up as tightly as he could—you have
the power of disposing of so many.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It so happens that I have permission to
reduce the stock—I believe that’s the expression—by
just such a number,” said the Colonel
more cheerfully; “and I most willingly invest
you with the power of disposing of them.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then I will take upon myself to state that
the Austral Agency Company will guarantee to
take up your bill next coming due, and to
provide you with funds to carry you over the
next shearing, when we may perhaps make a
more complete and satisfactory arrangement.”</p>

<p class='c017'>The Colonel gazed at Mr. Hope with an
expression as of one not fully realising the effect
of the words he heard with his outward ears.
Then suddenly stepping forward, he stretched
out his hand, and taking that of the younger
man wrung it silently.</p>

<p class='c017'>He retreated to his chair, where he sat down
with an expression of relief too deep for words.
He then left, apparently, all further transactions
of the interview in the hands of the “coming
race.”</p>

<p class='c017'>They began to go into detail a little, as if
about <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>un fait accompli</em></span>, Hubert, more particularly,
talking rapidly, in order to cover any appearance
of awkwardness on the part of his hosts.</p>

<p class='c017'>“You know,” he said, “that by doing this
travelling business, we ‘hedge,’ so to speak,
instead of standing to lose on the double event
of a dry season and a panic in the money market,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>more than any of us can afford. If the weather
breaks in February, of course we needn’t have
started, but we can’t lose anything, as our sheep
will be regularly run after when we get them
over, and at high prices too. They talk of
maiden ewes being worth a pound from the
shears, and anything else fifteen shillings, while
if it holds dry for three or four months here,
sheep will have to be given away, or next thing
to it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose I shall have to hire a lot of shepherds,”
said Willoughby; “that will be a nuisance,
won’t it?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If I were you I’d leave all that to Greenhaugh;
he’s accustomed to these fellows, and
knows how to talk to them on the road, which
you don’t. You’d better, ostensibly, be second
in command of the expedition. You won’t have
much responsibility, and will be able to pick up
heaps of experience. All you will have to find
will be your own horses. He’ll arrange everything
else and keep the accounts of rations and
wages, which you and I can settle when you
get there.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I suppose there’s a strong probability of a
drought setting in,” said Mr. Hope; “if not,
you will be rather premature.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The more I see of the weather signs, the
more certain I am that we are on the edge of
another drought, perhaps worse than the last,”
said Hubert. “You’ll see that a great many
people will hang on, expecting it to break up;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>then, making sure of getting the ‘tail end’ of
the tropical rains, and generally trusting to the
doctrine of chances until their sheep get too
weak to travel, and then—--”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And what then?” asked Willoughby. “I
haven’t had the pleasure of witnessing a dry
season as yet.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert smiled grimly. “You will thank
your stars the Wantabalree sheep cleared
out in time. You would never have forgotten
it as long as you lived. Some squatters will
lose half their stock, some two-thirds, some
even more. A man told me he lost a hundred
thousand sheep in the last drought. But <em>he</em> could
afford it.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“If it’s going to be so bad, what will your
governor and mine do with the sheep we leave
behind, for we must leave some.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They will have all the grass and water to
themselves, which will give them a chance, and
then, if it gets very cruel, they must cut scrub
and oak for them.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Cut the trees down!” said Willoughby,
with astonishment. “I never heard of such a
thing!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You’ll find out everything in time,” said
Hubert. “‘The brave old oak’ has an antipodean
signification here. I don’t know what we
should do without him in a dry time. I’ve
known sheep kept in good condition that hadn’t
seen grass for eighteen months.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Before the drive back, which took place after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>lunch, in the midst of pathetic leave-takings
between the Windāhgil girls and Miss Dacre,
the latter young lady took an opportunity of
expressing to Hubert her sincere gratitude for his
organisation of the opportune alliance which was,
so to speak, to raise the siege of Wantabalree.</p>

<p class='c017'>“It has made dearest papa quite young again,”
she said. “For weeks he has not been able to
sleep at night, but used to get up and go wandering
up and down the garden. I really began
to fear for his reason. And now he seems quite
a different man. I am so happy myself at the
change for the better, that I cannot feel properly
sorry that dear Willoughby is going away from
us.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“He is going among friends, at any rate,
Miss Dacre,” said Hubert, pressing the young
lady’s hand warmly in the agitation of the
moment. “He will be well looked after, rely
upon it. I feel certain it will be for everybody’s
benefit in the long run.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I shall always think that you and that good
genius, Mr. Hope, have stood between us and
ruin,” said she, and here her bright, steadfast
eyes were somewhat dimmed. “If papa does
not say all that is in his heart, believe me that
we are not ungrateful.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<em>Nothing</em> could ever lead me to think that,”
said Hubert meeting her eyes with a glance
which expressed more than that simple sentence,
if freely translated. “Whatever happens, I am
more than repaid by your approval.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>By this time Whalebone and Whipcord,
harnessed up and having their heads turned
homeward, began to exhibit signs of impatience,
which caused Linda to call out to Hubert that
she was sure Whipcord would throw himself
down and break the pole if they didn’t start at
once, which appalling contingency cut short the
interview, to Hubert’s secret indignation. This
expressed itself in letting them out with a will
and quitting Wantabalree at the rate of fourteen
miles an hour.</p>

<p class='c017'>Some people would have felt nervous at proceeding
along a winding, narrow bush road,
well furnished with stumps, at such an express
train rate, but the sure hand and steady eye of
Hubert Stamford, in combination with the light
mouths and regular if speedy movement of the
well-matched horses, engendered the most absolute
confidence in his driving.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What do you think of bush life generally,
Mr. Hope?” said Laura—after the first rush of
the excitable goers had steadied into a twelve-mile-an-hour
trot—“and how do you like
Wantabalree?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I think the Wantabalree people perfect in
their own way, worthy to be neighbours of
Windāhgil,” he added with a slight inclination
of his head. “A man could live there very
happily, ‘with one fair spirit to be his minister,’
if Miss Dacre would condescend to the office.
It’s a lovely verandah to read in. It would be
like the days of Thalaba, while it lasted.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“And why should it not last?” demanded
Laura. “The bush appears to me the place of
all others where the feelings and emotions are
the most permanent and deep-seated.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Barrington Hope fixed his eyes upon her as
she spoke with a gaze wistful and almost
melancholy in its earnestness.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Can anything endure that is fair, joyous,
dreamlike, in this uncertain life of ours?” he
said. “Is the ideal existence realised for most
of us, or, if so, does it continue? You are
more fortunate than I in your experiences, if
such is your belief.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Surely you have no reason to talk of
despondency,” said she, turning towards him
her bright face, in which the summer-time
seemed idealised. “You, who have made a
success in your profession, and whom everybody
talks of with—with, I won’t say admiration, it
might make you conceited—but high approval.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have done fairly well, I <em>suppose</em>,” he said.
“I may take it as the natural consequence of
twenty years’ hard, unrelieved work. I have
coined my brain, my very heart’s blood, for it;
and I will not say but that I have had my
reward in a proved success and high consideration.
But, at times, a feeling comes over me of
unrest and of doubt, well-nigh despair, as to the
reality of human happiness—the value of success—against
which I can scarcely defend
myself.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“You have been working too hard lately.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>Reaction has set in. In old days Hubert used
to suffer so, occasionally doubting whether life
was worth living, &amp;c. But with men it is
generally a temporary ailment. You must take
life easily for the next few weeks, and, like the
old farm labourer in the village church, ‘think
about nothing’—Linda and I must cultivate
part-singing, and improve our acquaintance with
Wagner, now that we have the benefit of your
criticism.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is a passing weakness, I suppose,” he
said; “still, you would wonder at its intensity.
But I didn’t come here to bore you with my
whims and fancies. One thing I shall carry
away as a pleasant souvenir—that Hubert and
I have been able to lighten the load on poor old
Colonel Dacre’s heart.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I <em>am</em> charmed beyond measure,” said Laura.
“Hubert told me something—though he is
such a close creature when he is speaking about
himself that I could get next to nothing out
of him. Willoughby will be able to get the
sheep away to Queensland, I suppose, with ours,
and they may not be ruined after all.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They will have a struggle, but I really
believe the station will pull through with
Hubert’s assistance and advice. If anything
serious does happen at Wantabalree, it will
not be for want of all the aid that an energetic
young friend can furnish. I can see as much as
that.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And so can I,” said Laura; “he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>find no better or sweeter reason if he looked for
a century.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Linda and Hubert, according to their wont
and usage, were embarked in such an animated
argument that it is probable they did not hear
this last confidential reference; more especially
as—perhaps for the greater convenience of
separate converse—the speakers’ voices had
become somewhat lowered, and Hubert’s attention
was partly taken up with his horses.</p>

<p class='c017'>The twenty miles were accomplished in less
than two hours. The horses in as hard condition
upon the now partially-dried summer
grasses as if they had been stabled, apparently
treated the drive as the merest trifle, trotting
off down the paddock, when released from
harness, apparently as free from fatigue as if
they had not gone a mile.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I must say your bush horses surprise me,”
said Mr. Hope. “They are like Arabs of the
desert for speed and hardihood.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“These two are a little out of the common,”
said Hubert; “not plentiful here or anywhere
else.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>The merry Christmastide was nearly spent—a
season fully enjoyed in those newer Englands,
which are growing fast and blooming fair
beneath the Southern Cross, in despite of the
red summer sun, and brown crisp pastures—a
blessed time of rest from toil, “surcease of
sorrow,” gathering of friends and kinsfolk.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>Barrington Hope had thoroughly enjoyed his
holiday; more, he averred than on any previous
vacation of his life. There had been walks,
drives and rides, picnics to the limestone caves
in the vicinity, where vast halls were explored
by the light of torches, stalactites brought home
in triumph, and wondrous depths of gloom and
primæval chaos penetrated; fishing parties on
the river, where, although the water trickled
faintly over the gravelly shallows, the wide
reaches were deep and sport-permitting. Occasional
visits to Mooramah township, their communication
with the outer world, helped to fill up
the term, and drive away the dreadful thought,
uppermost in the hearts of the Windāhgil family,
that Hubert was so soon to leave them for the
far north land.</p>

<p class='c017'>As soon as Christmas was well over the
serious work of the year—only interrupted by
this “truce of God”—began again with even
greater energy; the industrial battle, never long
pretermitted in Australia, raged furiously. So
there was great mustering on Windāhgil and
Wantabalree. Counting of sheep and tar-branding
of the same with the travelling “T,”
hiring of shepherds and “knock about” men.
Purchase of rations, tools, horses, drays, harness,
hobbles, “bells, bells, bells”—as Linda quoted—in
short, the thousand and one road requisites
for a long overland journey.</p>

<p class='c017'>Towards the end of January Mr. Donald
Greenhaugh arrived, riding one serviceable horse,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>and leading another, whereon, disposed over a
pack saddle, was all his worldly wealth deposited.
A keen-eyed, mild voiced Scottish-Australian,
sun-bronzed, and lean as an Arab, who looked
as if the desert sun had dried all superfluous
moisture out of his wiry frame, he superintended
the preparations at Windāhgil in a
quiet, superior sort of way, occasionally offering
suggestions, but chiefly leaving Hubert to manage
matters as he thought fit. He also found time
to go over to Wantabalree, where he remained
a week, meeting with apparently greater exercise
for his generalship.</p>

<p class='c017'>At length the great day of departure arrived.
The first flock of two thousand took the road
through the north Windāhgil gate, followed by
a second, at a decent interval, until the whole
thirty thousand sheep passed out. Next day the
advanced guard of the Wantabalree contingent
showed themselves—Greenhaugh having decided
to keep a day’s march between them. Forty
thousand of these came by. The fat and saleable
sheep of both stations had been retained. After
these had been sold in the autumnal markets
there would be but a small and manageable
balance on either station.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Colonel came as far as Windāhgil, and
even a stage further, with his daughter, to see
his boy off. They were dreadfully downhearted
and saddened in appearance as they called at
Windāhgil on their homeward route, but cheered
up a little under the attentions of sympathising
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>friends. Hubert had remained behind, not
choosing to follow for another week. He
was already beginning to assume the air of a
large operator and successful explorer. “Greenhaugh
can do all that business as well or better
than I can,” he said. “It’s no use paying a
man and doing the work yourself; I can catch
them up easily before they get to Banda.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Then we might have had Willoughby for
another week,” said Miss Dacre, with a slightly
reproachful air.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I don’t suppose it would have made much
difference,” admitted Hubert; “but it is perhaps
as well that he made the start with the
sheep. He has a larger lot to look after; I
don’t know but that it’s as well to have the
wrench at once, and get it over—like a double
tooth, you know.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It’s the most philosophical way to look
at it,” said the girl, smiling through her tears,
“and no tongue can tell the comfort it has been
to us to know that matters are in a comparatively
favourable train. I must not weary you
with protestations, but papa and I can never
adequately express our gratitude.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That could be done easily enough,” thought
the young man; but he said: “At present it’s
only a case of good intentions; we must wait
to see how they turn out. How will you and
the Colonel get on by yourselves?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Better than I at first thought; Willoughby
left us our working overseer, who will do excellently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>to look after a smaller number of sheep.
It will just give papa exercise, and occupation to
help him to manage them, he says. Laura and
Linda must be good neighbours, and perhaps
Mr. Stamford will come over now and then and
indulge papa with a game of whist.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I will undertake everything,” said Hubert,
“for our people, but you and the Colonel must
reciprocate. If both families make common
cause till ‘Johnny comes marching home’—I
mean Willoughby—you will find the time pass
more quickly than you anticipate.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Those last days of a pleasant holiday time,
what an element of sadness pervades them.
How swiftly they fly! Ah, me! The flowers
fade, the sky clouds over as if at the touch of
an untoward magician. The land of faery recedes—the
region of plain prose, of arduous
effort, and heroic but dreary self-abnegation
looms painfully near. Much, however, of this
sombre aspect of the inevitable is relieved in
early youth by the kindly glamour of high
hope, and the ardent imagination of the as
yet successful aspirant. For him the forest
gloom is but the high road to the castle of the
enchanted princess; the sternest tourney is
more than recompensed by the smiles of his
queen of beauty; the burning summer day, the
drear winter night, but aids to fortune and
accessories to boundless wealth.</p>

<p class='c017'>So, for Barrington Hope and Hubert Stamford,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>the tranquil days came and went, scarce
tinged with melancholy, till the fateful morn of
departure arrived; before noon Windāhgil was
left desolate and forsaken of its heroes. Hubert
fared forth along the north-west trail, bound for
the sea-like plains of the Lower Warroo, where
the wild orange flowers bloom on their lonely
sand islands, bright with glossy-leaved shrubs;
where the emu rears her brood undisturbed
under the sad-hued myall, that waves her
slender streamers and whispers ghost-like at
midnight to the pitiless desert moon.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Barrington Hope, on the other hand,
betook himself by rail to the metropolis, to
plunge once more, with the eagerness of a
strong swimmer, into the great ocean of speculative
finance, which there “heaves and seethes
alway.” But before he departed he had transacted
a rather important interview, in which
Laura Stamford was the person chiefly interested;
had, indeed, promised to revisit
Windāhgil before the winter ended.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Local critics were not lacking around
Mooramah, as in other places. They failed
not to make unfavourable comments upon
Hubert’s decided course of action. They were
pleased to say “that young man was going too
fast”—was leading his father into hazardous
speculations; all this new country that such a
fuss was made about was too far off to pay
interest upon the capital for years and years to
come; the Austral Agency Company had better
mind what they were about, or they would drop
something serious if they went on backing every
boy that wanted to take up outside country,
instead of making the most of what his family
had and helping his parents at home. As for
young Dacre, he would most likely get his sheep
eaten by the blacks and himself speared, as he
knew nothing about the bush, and hardly could
tell the difference between a broken-mouthed
ewe and a weaner. Besides, the season might
“turn round” after all—there was plenty of
time for rain yet. Most likely it would come
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>in February, as it had often done before.
Travelling sheep was a most expensive game,
and you were never done putting your hand in
your pocket.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus argued the unambitious, stay-at-home,
easy-going section of society which obtains in
rural Australia in almost the same proportion and
degree that it does in English counties. In the
older-settled portions of the land one may discern
the same tendency to over-crowding the
given area with unnecessary adults, procuring
but a bare subsistence, narrowing with each
generation as in Britain, where sons of proprietors
are too often contented to sink somewhat
in the social scale rather than forego the
so-called “comforts” of civilised life. The
poorly-paid curate, the Irish squireen, “Jock,
the Laird’s brother,” and the French <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>hobereau</em></span>,
so cordially hated by the peasantry before the
Revolution, are examples of this class.</p>

<p class='c017'>And, in the older-settled portions of Australia
are to be found far too many men of birth and
breeding who are contented to abide in the
enjoyment of the small amenities of country
town life, to sink down to the positions of
yeomen, farmers, and tenants, rather than turn
their faces to the broad desert as their fathers
did before them, and carve out for themselves,
even at the cost of peril and privation, a heritage
worthy of a race of sea kings and conquerors.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert Stamford did not belong, by any
means, to the contented mediocrities. Willoughby
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>Dacre was a kindred spirit. So the two young
men fared cheerfully forth across the dusty,
thirsty zone, beyond which lay the Promised
Land. Hard work and wearisome it was, in a
sense, but held nothing to daunt strong men in
the full vigour of early manhood. The days
were hot, and Willoughby’s English skin peeled
off in patches for the first week or two from the
exposed portions of his person. But cooler airs
came before midnight, and the appetites of both
after long days in the saddle were surprising.
The sheep, being in good condition at starting,
bore the forced marches, which were necessary,
fairly well. Donald Greenhaugh seemed to
know every creek, water-course, and spring in
the whole country. And on one fine day
Willoughby pulled up his horse, and in a tone
of extreme surprise exclaimed, “Why, there’s
grass!” pointing to a fine green tuft of the
succulent <em>Bromus Mitchelli</em>. It was even so.
They had struck the “rain line,” marked as
with a measuring tape. Henceforth all was
peace and plenty with the rejoicing flocks, which
grew strong and even fat as they fed onward
through a land of succulent herbage and full-fed
streams.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Well, Willoughby, old man; what do you
think of this?” asked Hubert one evening, as
they sat on a log before their tent and watched
the converging flocks feeding into camp; marked
also the fantastic summits of isolated volcanic
peaks which stood like watch-towers amid a grass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>ocean waving billowy in the breeze. “Do you
think we did well to cut the painter? How do
you suppose all these sheep would have looked
at Windāhgil and Wantabalree?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“They’ve had no rain yet,” said Willoughby.
“In that letter I got at the last township we
passed, the governor said there hadn’t been a
shower since I left. It’s nearly three months
now, and we should hardly have had a sheep to
our name by this time.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“There’ll be some awful losses in the district,”
said Hubert. “Men <em>will</em> put off
clearing out till too late. My own idea is that
this will be a worse drought all down the
Warroo than the last one. Our people will
make shift to feed the few sheep we have left,
thank goodness! And we have enough here to
stock more than one run or two either.
Windāhgil Downs will carry a hundred
thousand sheep if it will ten. All we have to
do now is to breed up. That’s plain sailing.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I wish we had some Wantabalree Downs
ready to take up,” said Willoughby, regretfully.
“If we hadn’t those beastly bills yet to pay, we
might have done something in that way too.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Wait till we’ve settled a bit, and have
landed the sheep all safe,” said Hubert.
“That will be stage the first. After we ‘see’
that, we must ‘go one better.’ Barrington
Hope is a good backer, and outside country is
to be had cheap just now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Events—in that sort of contrary way which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>occasionally obtains in this world—went far to
justify the bold policy of this confident young
man, who quietly ignored his elders, and to
confound the wise, represented by the cautious
croakers who stayed at home and disparaged
him.</p>

<p class='c017'>There had occurred a drought of crushing
severity but three years since, and only one
“good”—that is, rainy season had intervened,
so rendering it unlikely, and in a sense unreasonable
and outrageous, as one exasperated impeacher
of Providence averred, that another
year of famine should so soon succeed.
Nevertheless, the rain came not. The long,
hot summer waned. Autumn lingered with
sunny days and cold nights. Winter too, with
hard frosts, with black wailing winds, that
seemed to mourn over the dead earth and its
dumbly dying tribes. <em>But no rain!</em> No rain!
The havoc which then devastated all the great
district watered by the Warroo and its tributaries
was piteous, and terrible to behold.</p>

<p class='c017'>Rich and poor, small and great, owners of
stock fared alike. A herd of five thousand
head of cattle died on Murragulmerang to the
last beast. Eight thousand at Wando. John
Stokes, Angus Campbell, Patrick Murphy,
struggling farmers, lost every milch cow, every
sheep, every horse. They were too short of cash
to travel. Their small pastures of a few
hundred acres were as dust and ashes. Too
careless to provide a stock of hay and straw,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>selling all when prices were good, and
“chancing it,” they lost hoof and horn.
Mammoth squatters were short—fifty thousand
sheep—seventy thousand—a hundred thousand.
Smaller graziers with fifteen or twenty thousand,
lost two-thirds, three-fourths, four-fifths, as the
case may be. Ruin and desolation overspread
the land. Waggon loads of bales stripped
from the skins of starved sheep—“dead wool”
as it was familiarly called—were seen unseasonably
moving along the roads in all
directions.</p>

<p class='c017'>From all this death and destruction Hubert’s
family and the Wantabalree people had been
preserved, as they now gratefully remembered,
by his prompt yet well-considered action.
Harold Stamford, as he watched his stud flocks,
fairly nourished and thriving from constant
change of pasture which the empty paddocks
permitted, thanked God in his heart for the son
who had always been the mainstay of his
father’s house, while the Colonel was never
weary of invoking blessings on Hubert’s head,
and wishing that it had been his lot to have
been presented with a Commission in the
Imperial army, in which so bold and cool a
subaltern would have been certain to have distinguished
himself.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Better as it is, father,” said Miss Dacre;
“he might have sold out and lost his money in
a bad station. Except for the honour and glory,
I think squatting is the better profession, after
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>all; if Willoughby only turns out successful, I
shall think Australia the finest country in the
world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We shall have to live in it, my darling, for
a long time, as far as I see, so we may as well
think so,” said the Colonel. “Suppose we drive
over to Windāhgil, and have another rubber of
whist? Stamford plays a sound game, though
he’s too slow with his trumps; and Laura has
quite a talent for it—such a memory too!”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Many games of whist were played. Much
quiet interchange of hopes and fears, discussions
of small events and occurrences, such as make up
the sum of rural daily life, had taken place
between the two families ere the famine year
ended. It left a trail of ruin, not wholly financial.
Old properties had been sold, high hopes
laid low, never to arise; strong hearts broken.
“Mourning and lamentation and woe” had
followed each month, and still Nature showed no
sign of relenting pity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Through all this devastation the life of the
dwellers at Windāhgil had been comparatively
tranquil; if not demonstratively joyous, yet free
from serious mishap or anxiety. The tidings
from the far country were eminently satisfactory,
and as regular as circumstances would
permit.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Windāhgil Downs” was quoted as one of
the crack stations of North Queensland,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>and in order to devote his whole attention to
that principality in embryo, Hubert had sold his
share in the first station purchased to Willoughby
on long credit. All the Wantabalree sheep
were there, and doing splendidly. Mr.
Delamere and Willoughby were sworn friends,
and whenever Hubert could get a chance to
“come in” Delamere would take his place at
Windāhgil Downs, and leave Willoughby in
charge at the home station. Added to this, Mr.
Hope had “taken over” the Wantabalree
account, and saw no difficulty in providing for
future payment and working expenses.</p>

<p class='c017'>This was good news in every sense of the
word. The Colonel became so exceedingly
cheerful and sanguine, that his daughter again
asserted that he must be thinking of a stepmother
for her. In which behalf she implored
Laura and Linda to continue their complaisance
towards him, lest he should in despair go farther
afield, and so be appropriated by some enterprising
“daughter of Heth.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That is all very well,” said Linda; “I suppose
it’s a quiet way of warning us off. But
here we are living in a kind of pastoral
nunnery, with no society to speak of, and
nothing to do. The atmosphere’s pervaded
with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>bouquet de merino</em></span>, for though ours are all
right, I feel certain I can catch the perfume of
Mr. Dawdell’s dead sheep across the river.
Now, why shouldn’t I take compassion on the
Colonel? I like mature men, and can’t bear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>boys. I should rather enjoy ordering a superior
girl like you about. Wouldn’t it be grand,
Laura?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have no doubt Rosalind will grant you
her full permission,” said Laura, “if you think
such a little chit as you is likely to attract
a man like Colonel Dacre.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Little chit, indeed!” said Linda, indignantly.
“That’s the <em>very reason</em>. It would be my youth,
and freshness, and general stupidity (in the ways
of the world) that would attract him. Oh, dear!
think of the white satin, too! I should look so
lovely in white satin with a Honiton lace veil
and a train.” Then Linda began to walk up
and down the room in a stately manner, which
created a burst of laughter and general hilarity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Now that fortune had taken it into her head
to be kind, she, like other personages of her sex,
became almost demonstrative in her attentions.
Every letter from Queensland contained news of
a gratifying and exhilarating nature. Hubert
had heard of some “forfeited” country, of
which he had informed Willoughby, who,
having gone out with the requisite number of
sheep, blackfellows, and shepherds, had “taken it
up.” He expected in a year or so to sell a
portion of it, there being about a thousand
square miles altogether, and thus help to clear
off the Wantabalree account. As soon as they
got it into working order they would sell
Delamere and Dacre’s home station, with twenty
thousand sheep, and put all their capital into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>Glastonbury, as Mr. Delamere had chosen to
name the new property.</p>

<p class='c017'>Hubert had several times been offered a high
price for Windāhgil Downs, but he was not
disposed to sell on any terms, being bent on
stocking it up and improving it, so as fully to
develop its capacity. “Some day, when the
projected railway from Roma comes through,
we’ll have a syndicate formed to buy it,”
Hubert said. “In the meantime, there’s a few
thousand acres of freehold to pick up round old
Windāhgil.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“All this was very well,” said the dwellers in
the old homes; “but were the young men going
to stay away for ever? They might just as
well be in England. Surely, now that the season
had changed and everything was going on so
prosperously, they could afford two or three
months’ time to see their relatives.”</p>

<p class='c017'>This view of the case was pressed upon
Hubert’s attention in several of Laura’s letters.
Linda went so far as to threaten that she would,
in default of Hubert’s paying attention to her
next letter, invent an admirer of distinguished
appearance for Miss Dacre, which harrowing
contingency might serve to bring back the
wanderer.</p>

<p class='c017'>But there be many important, and, indeed, indispensable
duties in new country. Men are
scarce. Responsibilities are heavy. Risks abound.
The captain and the first mate cannot leave the
ship, be the inducements ever so great, until the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>anchor is down. Some day, however, the commander
dons his shore-going “togs,” frock coat,
tall hat, gloves, and all the rest of it, and goes
in for a little well-earned enjoyment.</p>

<p class='c017'>So, as again the summer days drew near, word
came that matters had so moulded themselves
that Hubert and Willoughby were on the homeward
track. The “home station” of Delamere
and Dacre had been sold to Messrs. Jinks and
Newboy with thirty-three thousand sheep at a
satisfactory price (<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>vide</em></span> the <em>Aramac Arrow</em>), as
the energetic proprietors had concluded to concentrate
their capital upon their magnificent
newly taken up property of Glastonbury.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Delamere was to locate himself thereon,
in the absence of his partner, while Donald
Greenhaugh would be left in charge of Windāhgil
Downs, now pretty well in working order.
Hubert and Willoughby would come down from
Rockhampton by steamer to Sydney, and might
be expected to be home in a month or six weeks
at farthest. This promise they faithfully carried
out, and by a remarkable coincidence, Mr.
Barrington Hope arranged to have a short
holiday, and come up to Windāhgil with them.</p>

<p class='c017'>There <em>is</em> a little true happiness in the world,
however hard-hearted materialists and cynical
poets affect to deny the fact. There might have
been an approximation in other young persons’
lives; to the state of blissful content in which
the two families were steeped to the lips on the
arrival of the long-absent heroes, but no conceivable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>satisfaction here below could have exceeded
it.</p>

<p class='c017'>The Colonel kept walking round his son,
taking in every personal detail with unflagging
interest for hours and hours, as Miss Dacre
averred; she was positive he never took his eyes
off him, except when he retired to bed, for a
whole week afterwards.</p>

<p class='c017'>Laura and Linda declared Hubert had grown
bigger, taller, handsomer, older—in short, had in
every way improved. Miss Dacre, when called
upon to confirm the decision, seemed to have a
slight difficulty in putting her opinion into suitable
form, but it was understood to be on the whole
favourable. At any rate, the object of all this
affectionate interest had reason so to believe.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Barrington Hope was surprised to find
both home stations alive and kicking—so to
speak—after the terrific ordeal which they had
undergone. But, as he remarked, understocking
was a more scientific mode of management than
most squatters would allow. It was many a
year since the paddocks on either station had
looked so well. As to the non-wool-bearing
inhabitants, he was lost in astonishment at their
brilliant appearance after the deprivation of so
many of the comforts of life.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We were sorely tempted to go away to
Sydney during the worst part of the drought,”
said Laura. “Father gave us leave at the end
of one terrible month, when we had not tasted
milk, butter, or any decent meat. But as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>Mr. Dacre and Hubert were living on salt beef
and ‘pig’s face’ (<em>Mesembryanthemum</em>) when last
heard from, and risking their lives as well—moreover,
as Rosalind wouldn’t hear of leaving
the Colonel—we determined to bear our share
of discomfort also.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I declare I grew quite nice and thin,” said
Linda, who was sometimes uneasy about a
possibly redundant figure; “mine was just what
the old novelists used to call ‘a slight, but
rounded form.’ Laura and poor Rosalind fell
off dreadfully, though. No vegetables either.
We were reduced to eating an onion one day
with positive relish. Father said it was medicinally
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Good heavens, if I had had the least idea
that matters were so bad,” said Mr. Hope,
glancing at Laura with a look of the tenderest
compassion, “I should have insisted upon everybody
migrating to Sydney, and come up in
person to take charge, or done something
desperate. I should indeed.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That would have been a last resource,” said
Hubert, laughing. “Fancy the Austral Agency
Company, with the manager ruralising at such a
time! That would have caused a financial
earthquake, which would have been more serious
than the absence of milk and butter and a short
supply of vegetables. Never mind, it was
only a temporary inconvenience—much to be
lamented, doubtless—but everybody looks very
nice, notwithstanding.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>“I suppose we can put up with the old place
for a few weeks longer?” interposed Mr.
Stamford. “After Christmas, as we’ve all been
such good boys and girls, I think we’re due for
another trip to Sydney. I want to see the
pantomime, for one. Miss Dacre requires
change of air. I’m not sure that the climate of
Tasmania or Melbourne wouldn’t brace us
all up after the rather—well, not particularly
exciting life we’ve had for the last year.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Oh! you dear old father,” said Linda;
“you’re a man of the most original ideas and
splendid ingenuity. You’ve divined our inmost
thoughts intuitively.”</p>

<p class='c017'>With such a prospect before them, the
members of both families endured the unmistakably
warm weather which generally precedes
Christmas with philosophical composure. Indeed,
so extremely contented were they with the
existing state of affairs, that Linda vowed it was
hardly worth while going away at all. This
unnaturally virtuous state of mind was, however,
combated by the majority, who possibly had
reasons of their own for desiring to wander for a
season far from their usual surroundings, for
early in the first week of the new year the
<cite>Mooramah Independent, and Warroo, Eyall, and
Bundaburhamah Advertiser</cite> contained this wildly
interesting announcement:—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c1'>
<div class='nf-center c016'>
    <div>“MARRIAGES.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c011'>“On the 3rd January, by the Rev. Edward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>Chalfont, at St. John’s Church, Mooramah,
Hubert, eldest son of Harold Stamford, Esq., of
Windāhgil, to Rosalind, only daughter of
Lieutenant-Colonel Rupert Dacre, of Wantabalree,
late of H.M. 83rd Regiment. At the
same time and place, Barrington, second son of
Commander Collingwood Hope, R.N., to Laura,
eldest daughter of Harold Stamford, Esq., of
Windāhgil.”</p>

<p class='c012'>These momentous events were not wholly
unexpected. It may be imagined how the
church at Mooramah was crowded on that day.
It was not a particularly small one either, having
been built mainly through the exertions of an
energetic young clergyman, who did not allow
himself to be discouraged by the fact that a
considerable debt thereon still remained unpaid.
So there was not a seat, or half a seat, to be had
inside, while a much larger congregation than
usual stood around the porch and entrance
doors. School children strewed flowers on the
pathway of the happy brides, and none of the
usual ceremonies were omitted.</p>

<p class='c017'>As it had not rained for three months, and
apparently was not likely to do so for three
more, the old-word proverb, “happy is the bride
that the sun shines on,” received most literal
fulfilment. However, the near prospect of
ocean breeze and plashing wavelets sustained
them amid the too ardent sun rays. Hubert, as
a local celebrity, came in for a certain amount of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>guarded approval, and, in spite of the misgivings
with which his Napoleonic policy had
been regarded, it was conceded that “he looked
twice the man” since his departure for foreign
parts. Rosalind Dacre quietly, though becomingly,
dressed, on that account was thought to
have scarcely paid due and befitting regard to
her serious and sacred duty as a bride. But as
to Laura, there was no thought of dispraise or
any, the faintest, doubt. Universally admired
and beloved, the flower of a family not less
popular than respected in the district, each one
in that crowded building seemed to take a
personal pride in her day of maiden triumph.
Barrington Hope, radiantly happy and enjoying
the prestige of a distinguished stranger, also
received the highest compliments of the spectators
by being declared to be worthy of the
belle of Mooramah.</p>

<p class='c017'>The happy couples departed by train to Melbourne,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>en route</em></span> for Tasmania, that favoured
isle where the summer of Britain is reproduced
with the improved conditions of assured fine
weather, and a less inconvenient proximity to
the Pole. There annually do the desert-worn
pilgrims from the tropic north and central
wastes of the Australian continent resort for
coolness, greenery, and agreeable society, as to
the garden of Armida. Thus, in those rare
intervals when they were not engaged in gazing
on the perfections of their brides, were Hubert
Stamford and Barrington Hope enabled to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>indulge in a little pioneer talk, and to listen to
far-off echoes from the wild scenes which the
former had so lately quitted.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. and Mrs. Stamford, with Linda, remained
for a few days longer before they took wing
for the metropolis, leaving behind the Colonel
and Willoughby, who elected to remain at home
in charge of both stations. They arrived in
Sydney just in time to take leave of their friends,
the Grandisons. Chatsworth had been let for a
term of years, and preparations were complete
for their going to live upon one of the station
properties.</p>

<p class='c017'>“The fact is, my dear fellow,” said Mr.
Grandison, “that my wife and I have resolved
to take these younger children up into the bush
and live there quietly with them till their
education is finished. We must try if possible
to bring them up in an atmosphere untainted
by fashionable folly and excitement. It has
been the ruin (at least, I think so) of the older
ones. Now that Josie has married—--”</p>

<p class='c017'>“What! Josie married?” exclaimed Mr.
Stamford. “I never heard of it. You astonish
me!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Married, indeed,” said Mrs. Grandison, who
now joined them; “and a pretty match she has
made of it. Not that there’s anything against
the young man—he’s two or three years
younger than she is—except that he’s rather
stupid, and hasn’t an idea of anything, except
billiards and betting, that I can discover. As
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>he’s only a clerk in an insurance office, he has
just enough to keep himself and not a penny for
a wife, unless what her parents give her.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“The sort of young fellow I never shall be
able to take the slightest interest in,” said Mr.
Grandison; “not bad-looking, I suppose, but
quite incapable of raising himself a single step
by his own exertions, or aspiring to anything
beyond a sufficiency of cigars and an afternoon
lounge in George Street.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Of course you tried to prevent the
marriage,” said Mrs. Stamford; “but it’s too
late now to do anything but make the best of it,
for poor Josie’s sake.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Grandison turned away his head as his
wife said, in a tone of deep feeling, “The silly
girl went and was married before the Registrar.
She knew we could not approve of it, and took
that means of being beforehand with us. Her
father won’t see her yet; but of course she’ll
have an allowance, and we must help them if he
keeps steady. But it nearly broke our hearts,
you may believe.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“We see all these things too late,” said her
husband, with a sigh, which he tried bravely to
repress. “If we had brought our children up
with other ideas, or placed before them higher
objects of ambition, a different result might
have been reached. Over and over again have
I cursed the day when we left the bush for
good—for good, indeed!—and came to live in
this city of shams. Not worse than other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>places, I believe; but all this artificial town life,
while not too good for older people, is ruin and
destruction for young ones. What a fortunate
man you’ve been, Stamford, though, in our
selfish grief, I’ve forgotten to congratulate
you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“It is the goodness of God,” he replied,
warmly grasping the hand which was silently
held out to him. “My children have never
given me a moment’s anxiety. We have been
sheltered, too, from the temptations of the
world, and so far from the ‘deceitfulness of
riches.’ I can never be sufficiently thankful.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“That won’t last long,” said Mr. Grandison,
with an effort to be cheerful. “People tell me
that Windāhgil Downs is going to be the finest
sheep property west of the Barcoo, and Hubert’s
reputation as a pioneer is in everybody’s mouth
now. He managed to pull the Colonel’s investment
out of the fire. Well paid for it too,
by all I hear! Give our love to Laura. She
must live in Sydney, I suppose, now she’s
married a business man. A rising fellow,
Barrington Hope, and one of the smartest
operators we have. Heigho! time’s up. We
shall meet again some day I hope, when I have
a better story to tell you.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Stamford was sincerely grieved to hear
of this latest misfortune of the Grandison
family. She could hardly forgive Josie for the
insincerity and ingratitude with which she had
acted. “However,” said the kindly matron in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>continuation, “perhaps it is not so bad as they
are disposed to think. They’re dreadfully disappointed,
of course. If the young man’s
character is good, he may get on, and of course
Mr. Grandison will help them by and by. It
will do Josie good to have a house of her own
to look after, and to be obliged to save and contrive.
The girl’s heart is not naturally bad, I
believe; but she has been spoilt by over-indulgence
and extravagance ever since she was a
baby. A poor marriage may be the best thing
that ever happened to her. Oh! Harold,
should we not be deeply grateful for the mercy
of Providence in so ordering our lives that
until lately we have never had any money to
spare, and self-denial has been compulsory?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“H’m,” said Mr. Stamford, musingly; “no
doubt, no doubt! Too much money is one
form of danger, of moral death, which the devil
must regard with great, great complacency. Few
people take that view, though.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am very glad we have never been tried
in that way,” said Mrs. Stamford, simply,
looking up into her husband’s face. “I have
pitied you, darling, when I have seen you tormented
and anxious about money matters, but
we have always been very happy among ourselves,
even when things were at their worst.
There is no chance now, I suppose, of our affairs
going wrong? These Queensland stations are
quite safe!”</p>

<p class='c017'>“Quite safe, my dearest wife,” answered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>Harold Stamford, with a pang of remorse at his
heart, as he imprinted a kiss on the fond face
which had never looked into his save with truth
and love shining in her clear eyes. “‘Safe as a
bank,’ or suppose we say as Australian debentures.
I don’t mind affirming that nothing,
humanly speaking, could materially injure our
investments now.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I am glad to hear that, for the dear children’s
sake,” she answered. “If their future is secured,
that is everything.”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Before the close of the summer, a naval
squadron cruising in Australian waters, strange
to say, happened to need partial refitting in
Sydney Harbour, and, entering that picturesque
haven, anchored as usual in Farm Cove. In one
of the delicious sea-girdled nooks of Neutral
Bay, it so chanced that Mr. Stamford had rented
a furnished villa for the season. The ladies
were wont to use the telescope in close inspection
of any strange vessel that approached.
Wonderful to relate, it appeared that the frigate
which on a previous occasion had been the ocean
home of Lieutenant Fitzurse was even now
among the graceful war-hawks which, after
battling with storm and tempest, were, so to
speak, furling their pinions under Linda’s excited
gaze.</p>

<p class='c017'>There may or may not be a new system of
marine telegraphy, but the fact comes within
my experience that naval men have exceptionally
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>prompt means of discovery, upon arrival in port,
whether the ladies of their acquaintance are in
town, and if so, where they abide.</p>

<p class='c017'>It so chanced, therefore, that, upon the following
afternoon, a gig left H.M.S. <em>Vengeful</em>, and
with eight able seamen pulled straight for the
Dirrāhbah jetty, landing the lieutenant and a
brother officer, who, making their call in due
form, betrayed great anxiety for the health of
Mr. and Mrs. Stamford and the young ladies
during their long absence from Sydney. They
were also politely astonished at the news of Miss
Stamford’s and Hubert’s marriages. Indeed,
the recital of the family news (presumably) as
conveyed by Linda to Mr. Fitzurse in full,
during an examination of the green-house, lasted
so long that Mrs. Stamford looked several times
from the window, and the gallant tars in the
boat referred to the protracted absence of their
superior officers in unqualified Saxon terms.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>What more is left to tell? It would appear
that there might have been a previously implied,
if unspoken confession between the young
people. Reference being permitted to Stamford
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><em>père</em></span>, and satisfactory credentials forthcoming, it
was arranged that an “engagement” should be
officially allowed, hope being cautiously held out
by that wary diplomatist that, in the event of
the coveted “step” being attained, the full concession
might be thought about. Which
decision gave unqualified satisfaction, Linda
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>being, as she averred, willing to wait for years;
indeed rather glad on the whole, that separation
and delay were necessary, so that she might have
time to think over and thoroughly enjoy her
unparalleled happiness.</p>

<p class='c017'>With the autumn came the returning travellers,
Hubert declaring that he dared not stay
away another week from the Downs; frightful
consequences might happen; Mr. Hope and
Laura preparing to inhabit the comfortable
abode which, for a few years to come, they had
agreed, would be commensurate with their means.
Something was said about Mrs. Hubert Stamford
remaining at Wantabalree with her father
while her husband went forth again on his task
of subduing the waste. But that young woman
replied promptly, with the opening words of an
ancient family record, “Where thou goest, I will
go.” In reference to the possibly rude architecture
of their abode, she declared “that if
Hubert had only a packing case to live in,
she, being his wife, thought it her duty to live
there with him.”</p>

<p class='c017'>After this, of course, there was no more to be
said, and the <em>Catterthun</em>, sailing soon afterwards
for the uttermost northern port, had in her
passenger list the names of Mr. and Mrs.
Hubert Stamford and servant.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>From this time forth the star of Stamford
family was manifestly in the ascendant; for
not only did their undertakings flourish and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>the sons and daughters of the house “grow in
favour with God and man,” but everyone
bound to them by the ties of kindred or friendship
prospered exceedingly. The debt on
Wantabalree was cleared off in due time, while
the “Glastonbury Thorn” seemed to have
taken deep root in the northern wilds of the far
land to which it had been carried, and to bring
a blessing upon the dwellers around its sacred
stem. The Colonel lived rather a solitary existence
at the home station after Willoughby
had departed again for the north, but he got
into the way of going to Sydney for the summer,
where the Australian Club afforded him congenial
society, with a certainty of comradeship
at the nightly whist table.</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. and Mrs. Hubert Stamford returned
after a year’s absence, the latter, though having
lost something of her English freshness of
complexion, by no means delicate of health, and
very proud of the infant Harold, whose steadfast
eyes and bold brow marked him out as a
future pioneer. Neither were sorry to abide
with the Colonel for a season, and Hubert threw
out hints about “the far north” being too
hot for any white woman, although Rosalind
would rather die than admit it. “She’s the
pluckiest little woman in the world, I believe,”
he said. “Didn’t she wash and cook for me
and Donald the whole month we were without
a servant? I believe she’d have kept the
station accounts too, if we’d have let her. But
I don’t want to run risks.”</p>

<p class='c017'><span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>Mr. and Mrs. Stamford, being more impartial
observers, were of opinion that a change would be
beneficial to both the young people. Hubert
was too thin to satisfy the maternal eye. She
believed that he had never properly got over that
horrid fever and ague attack. “And of course
Hubert would never give in; but really as the
boy had done so well, wouldn’t it be a nice
time for them to run home for a year or two?
The station was settling down, and as Mr.
Greenhaugh had been taken into partnership,
surely he could manage things for a time? It
would benefit Hubert in every way, and as
he had never been ‘home,’ of course they
would like him to see a little of the world.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Something of this sort may have occurred to
Mr. Stamford, but he had refrained in order to
permit his more cautious helpmate to propose
the extravagant notion. He shook his head
oracularly, said he would think over it, and if it
was decided—mind, if after due consideration
it turned out to be feasible—he thought it
would do Barrington and Laura a great deal of
good too. Barrington would knock himself up if
they didn’t mind. He was such a terribly constant
worker, and so conscientious that he did not
permit himself the relaxation that other men in
his position would have claimed.</p>

<p class='c017'>“What a splendid idea!” exclaimed Mrs.
Stamford; “my dear Harold, you always seem
to hit upon the exact thing we have all been
thinking of but have hesitated about mentioning.
It will be the saving of Barrington, and as for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Laura, the great dream of her life will be fulfilled.
I know she almost pines for Rome and
Florence, but she told me once she did not think
they could afford it for some years to come.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“<em>I</em> can afford it, though,” said Mr. Stamford,
with pardonable exultation. “Things have
prospered with us lately. And what have we
to think of in this world but our children’s
happiness? Barrington shall have a cheque for a
thousand the day their passage is taken. As for
Hubert, he can draw one for himself now, thank
God! without interviewing his banker.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mrs. Stamford was an economical and intelligent
woman as to her household accounts, but
she had the vague idea of “business” common
to her sex. She knew in a general way from
her son and husband that the stations were all
paying and improving in value. So she accepted
the situation without further inquiry. When
her husband, therefore, spoke of drawing so
large a cheque for travelling expenses, she was
not alarmed as she would once have been at the
idea of paying a tenth part of the amount, but
regarded the apparent profusion of money in
the family as a consequence of the higher
standard of pastoral property which they had
been so wonderfully guided to reach. “Hitherto
has the Lord helped us,” she quoted softly to
herself. “May His mercy be around our paths
and shield those who are dear to us from every
evil!”</p>

<p class='c017'>The news that a trip to the old country was
not only possible but considered expedient, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>in a sense necessary, came with the effect of a
delightful surprise upon both couples. Hubert
had, in a hazy, contemplative way been revolving
the idea, but had not thought it likely
that it could be arranged in less than three or
four years. But now, brought face to face with
the idea, he found it to be unexpectedly
practicable. There was no very complicated
work or management necessary for two or three
years. Donald Greenhaugh, who had now a
fourth share, was fully able to superintend the
ordinary station work. Fencing, branding the
increase and selling the fat stock, were operations
which he could conduct as well as—in a sense
better—than Hubert could himself. In case
“anything happened to him”—and such things
have occurred ere now, disastrously for the
absentee partner—there was Willoughby, with
whom he could leave a power of attorney, on
the spot. All that was wanted was to increase
the cattle herd from five thousand head to
twenty, and that would not half stock the runs.
The sheep of course were right. One man of
experience could see to that process nearly as
well as another.</p>

<p class='c017'>Barrington Hope too, urged by his wife, who
was fully of opinion that he worked too hard,
also that a purely sedentary life was drawing
fresh lines upon his brow, and prematurely
ageing him—pressed firmly his claim for a
lengthened vacation. To that end a relieving
manager was appointed to take his place during
his absence. When he found that Mr. Stamford’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>liberality was about to take such a pleasing
form, he was indeed surprised as well as
gratified. That gentleman felt it necessary to
make a slight explanation as to his private
means, but he merely mentioned that he was
now possessed of certain family funds not available
at the time of their first acquaintance, and
could therefore well afford the outlay.</p>

<p class='c017'>As for Laura, it seemed as if the old days of
nursery tales had come back. The fairy godmother
had arisen and gifted her with the precise
form of happiness previously as impossible as a
slice of the moon. It had long been the wish
of her heart to behold, to wander amid, those
historic relics, those wondrous art creations,
those hallowed spots with which her reading and
her imaginative faculty had rendered her so
familiar. It was her favourite dream for middle
life. When years of self-denial and steady
industry had wrought out the coveted independence,
<em>then</em> the journey into the land of
ancient fame, of wonder, mystery, and romance,
was to be their reward. But to think of its
being vouchsafed to them in their youth, before
the stern counsel of middle age, with its slower
heart-currents, had warned them that the years
were slowly advancing, fated to carry with them
the best treasures of life.</p>

<p class='c017'>And oh, gracious destiny! in the full tide of
youthful feeling, of the joyous exalting sense of
happiness born of the unworn heart of youth,
<em>now</em> to bestow on them these all-priceless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>luxuries! It was more than wonderful—it was
magical. Who were they to have so much undeserved
happiness showered upon them? Hubert
and Rosalind would join them, perhaps to part
in England for a while. But they would roam
the Continent together, they could in company
gaze upon the dead giantess Rome; the city by
the sea, even Venice; resting under the shade of
German pine forests, they could listen to weird
legends beneath the shadow of the Hartz
Mountains. Oh! joy, glory, peace unspeakable!
What an astonishing change in their
life-history! And to think that in less than a
month—so it had been ordered—they would be
saying farewell to the land of their birth!</p>

<p class='c017'>It was felt by the Colonel and Willoughby to
be an unfair stroke of destiny that Rosalind, the
chief joy and glory of their life, should be
spirited away to Europe. But her father also
considered that, when in Queensland, she was
virtually as far from his ken, while the
pleasures and advantages procurable from the
former locality bore no comparison with the
latter. There was an unspoken wish also on the
part of the elder relatives that the Australian
contingent should enjoy the inestimable advantage
of beholding with their own eyes the
wonders of the other hemisphere, of forming an
alliance by personal experience with the glory
and the loveliness, the literature and art of the
ancient world, to endure in memory’s treasure-house
till life’s latest hour.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
</div>

<p class='c012'>Barrington Hope could hardly realise the
fact, till he found himself actually on board
of a mail steamer, that he would have no
business cares for the next two years—a whole
elysium of rest and recreation. For this respite
from the “figure and fact” mill, Laura was
deeply grateful, sensible as she had been for
some months past that the calculating machine
was working under occasional effort.</p>

<p class='c017'>When the Hubert Stamfords and Hopes
bestowed themselves on board the <em>Lahore</em>—the
last triumph of the Peninsular and Oriental
Company—one would have thought all Sydney
was coming to say farewell—such was the congregation
on the deck and in the magnificent
saloon of that noble vessel. Of course the
Colonel and Willoughby, Mr. and Mrs. Stamford,
and all their Sydney friends turned out on
purpose to “see them off” as the phrase is,
according to British etiquette on such occasions.
Other people—friends and relatives—had come
to say farewell to their wives and daughters,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>sons and sweethearts. Thus many a saddened
countenance and tearful eye were to be noted as
the great steamer moved slowly astern, and then
glided at half-speed down the harbour.</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Of their safe and pleasant voyage—of fast
friends, and congenial acquaintances made on
board and parted from with regret—what need
to speak? Of the entrance to fairyland which
the first few months’ sojourn in the dear old
island so closely resembles for home-returning
Australians. Of the stores of information
acquired. Of the intoxicating luxury of mere
existence under such conditions. Of the transcending
of all anticipation and belief.</p>

<p class='c017'>Barrington Hope and Laura remained in
Europe for the full term of their holiday—two
years. But six months ere that period closed
Hubert and his wife became impatient to return
to their life-task in the south land, too satiated
with mere sensuous enjoyment to remain
longer.</p>

<p class='c017'>“We are young and strong, thank God,”
said Hubert; “it’s not as though we did not
see our way to be back here again within a
reasonable time. But my work lies in Australia,
and I can’t settle to this kind of easy-going life
just yet. When Windāhgil Downs is in
thorough working order and fully stocked, we
can treat ourselves to a run home every five
years or so without feeling uneasy about the
seasons or anything else. So we’ll just take our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>passage by the next boat and wake them up at
Mooramah once more.”</p>

<p class='c017'>“I’m ready, dearest,” said his wife. “With
you, I think our work is only half-done, and the
sooner we commence life in earnest the better.
We’ve seen picture galleries enough to last us
for the next few years, and I begin to pine for
a sight of my dear old father, and Willoughby,
poor boy! I wonder how they are getting on at
Wantabalree?”</p>

<hr class='c007' />

<p class='c017'>Once more the family circles were replenished,
irradiated by the old love and tenderness in the
persons of the wanderers—once more grateful
hearts were full to overflowing, and humble
thanks were offered up to the Supreme Power
which had permitted their happy reunion, in
spite of perils by land and sea—the thousand
chances of danger and death which had irrevocably
marred less fortunate households. All had
gone well in their absence—Linda and her sailor
love had been made mutually happy, and
through the exercise of judicious local interest
Captain Fitzurse, as he was now proudly styled
by mankind and his adoring bride, had secured
a colonial appointment involving naval duty,
but not forbidding the occupation of one of
those delightful marine residences of which
Sydney boasts so many perfect specimens.</p>

<p class='c017'>Donald Greenhaugh had amply justified the
confidence bestowed on him. The stations were
growing and flourishing to the fullest extent of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>sanguine expectation. Willoughby had developed
into a stalwart bushman, properly
bronzed and duly experienced in all pastoral
lore. The seasons “out back” had been good.
Nothing was wanting of all the conditions of
permanent prosperity.</p>

<p class='c017'>Of all the members of the two families so
happily united and thankfully enjoying their
unwonted success, universally admired and
envied, Mr. Stamford alone seemed to be laden
with care. At times abstracted and preoccupied,
silent and grave amidst the family hilarity; at
whist, striking out confusing lines of play, for
which no precedent could be found. Such was
his departure in general behaviour from the
ordinary cheerful and equable habit that his
wife and children commenced seriously to fear
that the unwonted prosperity had turned his
head, or that old anxieties had induced morbid
action of the brain. The Colonel shook his
head as he delicately alluded to the melancholy
fact in a walk with Rosalind. It would grieve
him to the heart. He didn’t think really he
could stay on at Wantabalree; that a man who
could lead from a weak suit and play the Queen
of Hearts when the King was still <span lang="it" xml:lang="it"><em>in petto</em></span>, <em>must</em>
be suffering from incipient softening of the
brain, was patent to him.</p>

<p class='c017'>The fact was that Mr. Stamford had come to
the conclusion that the time had arrived when it
was necessary to make a clean breast of his
secret. And he did not like the idea at all.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>When the matter was buried in his own breast
and in that of Mr. Worthington, than whom
his own iron safe was not more reticent of
office secrets, it did not, like other hidden deeds,
appear so frightful. But now, after all these
years, to be compelled to tell his wife and
children, who believed that they shared every
thought of his heart, that he had carefully,
wilfully, artfully concealed from them the
knowledge of their true position! He could
hardly stand up and face the idea. “What if
his children should resent this want of all confidence?
Would his wife think that all her
love and trust deserved a different return?”</p>

<p class='c017'>Mr. Stamford wiped his heated brow and
thought the position unendurable. Still, the
motive was a good one, a pure one, even practical.
And how had it worked? The result
might not have directly proceeded from the
means employed; but still everything had
followed for which he had hoped and prayed.</p>

<p class='c017'>His children had not shrunk from any test of
self-denial, of fortitude, of continuous industry
rendered necessary by the apparent narrowness
of their fortunes. True, they were at the same
time actuated by filial reverence and family love,
swayed by the tenets of that religious teaching
which from their infancy had been unwaveringly
inculcated. But could these influences have
been sufficiently strong to counteract the strong
currents of ease and pleasure, the soft zephyrs of
flattery, the clinging weight of indolence, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>urging towards the wreck-strewn shore of self-indulgence,
when once the fatal knowledge
should be acquired that all care for the morrow
was superfluous?</p>

<p class='c017'>Who shall say? Had not the fate of his
friend’s family, the melancholy failure of even
his modest aspirations for social distinction,
been as a beacon light and a warning?</p>

<p class='c017'>As it was, every noble feeling, every desire to
spare no effort either of mind or body which
could tend to raise the fortunes and to lighten
the hearts of those so dear to him, had been
stimulated and intensified in his son and heir by
the sharp urgency and weight of the Alternative.
His daughters had emulated their mother’s virtues
and with uncomplaining patience had endured
isolation, monotony, plain living, and sparing
apparel. For this they had had their reward—doubtless.
But would all these fragrant flowers
of the soul have thriven and bloomed in the
ungenial soil of luxury, and the indolence born
of unwonted, uncounted wealth?</p>

<p class='c017'>Whatever had been his sin of omission or
commission, could he fairly be chargeable with
apathy as to the welfare of his children?</p>

<p class='c017'>For them, and in their interest, he had striven
in every conscious hour from that of their birth
until now. For them he had toiled and endured
hardness—had hoped and prayed. For their
welfare in this world and the next was his every
waking thought engaged. Other than these
had he no pleasures worthy of the name in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>latter years of a life now approaching—slowly,
but still approaching—the inevitable close. He
had, it was true, chosen an unusual mode, but
withal an intelligible course of action.</p>

<p class='c017'>Looking at the question in all its points, and
pushing the reasoning on either side to its conclusion,
Mr. Stamford began to find his position
more tenable than he had expected. After all,
he had only done in life what most people did
in death—reserved the distribution of his fortune
until a later period, for the eventual benefit
of his children.</p>

<p class='c017'>Thus fortified, Mr. Stamford, having made up
his mind, as the phrase runs, resolved to communicate
the terrible secret fully and finally to
his assembled family that very evening, being
averse to spoiling another night’s rest with a
burden of thought the weight of which had
become so oppressive. It happened that the
Colonel and Willoughby were at Windāhgil,
so Mr. Stamford rightly judged that it would
save all after trouble of explanation if he made
his Budget speech when nearly all concerned
were present.</p>

<p class='c017'>Partly in deference to the Colonel’s habitudes
and those of the European travellers, the fashion
of a late dinner had been revived at Windāhgil.
Everybody had been unusually cheerful. The
never-failing fund of Continental or English
experiences had been drawn upon over the
“walnuts and the wine,” or rather, when grapes
and peaches were receiving attention—Hubert
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>had been laughingly threatening Rosalind with
a dozen more years of Queensland life—when
Mr. Stamford stood up and remarked that “the
time had arrived when he felt it his duty to
make a statement which had been, for reasons
of his own, postponed—perhaps unnecessarily
so. However, it deeply concerned the interests
of all present, directly or indirectly, and as he
said before, the time had come for him to explain,
he might say disclose, the a—a—affair.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here Mr. Stamford, who was not a fluent
speaker, became aware that though he had not
furnished a particularly accurate termination to
his last sentence, he had at all events sufficiently
puzzled, not to say alarmed, his audience. He
therefore filled his glass and sipped it slowly,
while Mrs. Stamford looked wistfully at him.
Laura gazed with fully opened eyes, in which
might be observed a slight glimmer of dread;
Hubert waited calmly for the next words, and
Mr. Hope and the Colonel politely preserved a
studied indifference. Rosalind took the cue
from her husband, and betrayed no uneasiness
by word or gesture.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My dearest wife, my children, my friends,”
the speaker proceeded, “what I have to tell you
is rather of a pleasing than of an alarming
nature. The only awkwardness of my position
arises from uncertainty as to whether I ought
to have said what I do now several years ago.
I can truly assert that it is the only secret I
ever kept from my dear wife, or even from my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>children since they arrived at years of discretion.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here everybody’s face expressed different
degrees of amazement.</p>

<p class='c017'>The orator continued. “The leading fact is
that I am a much richer man than is generally
supposed.” (“Hear, hear,” from the Colonel.)
“In a year we all remember well, as you will
see by the date of this letter, I was left
£170,000 or thereabouts by a relative. You
do not forget the dry year in which we were
so nearly ruined? We recovered our position
chiefly through the well-considered, safe, yet
liberal action of my dear son-in-law, Barrington
Hope. The gratitude I felt for the way in
which he then acted, strictly consonant as it was
with proper business principles, is still warm and
fresh in my recollection.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here Laura’s eyes sparkled.</p>

<p class='c017'>“Immediately after this comparative good
fortune I received this letter, which told me
of a bequest beyond all hope or expectation.
It rendered me a rich, a very rich man, as
fortunes go in Australia. Circumstances which
then came under my observation caused me to
doubt whether a sudden accession of wealth
would act beneficially upon the as yet unformed
characters of my darling children. Up to that
period their dispositions, their principles, had
been all the fondest parent could have wished.
Why, then, run the risk of an alteration, necessarily
for the worse? Would they so continue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>under a total change of conditions and prospects?
I felt doubtful, judging from analogy. So
deeply was the danger to them at such a critical
period of their lives borne in upon me, that
I took time to consider my course of action.
Finally, after deep thought and earnest prayer,
I resolved to withhold the important intelligence—to
permit them to remain in ignorance of
aught but a gradual relief from threatened ruin.
In short, I elected to live our old life, gradually
modified and developed, until, in course of
time, their characters had acquired maturity,
with that strength to resist all ordinary temptation
which I hoped and trusted the coming
years would bring. My secret was known to
but one man, our trusted legal adviser and
friend, Mr. Worthington. Meanwhile, I proposed
judiciously to improve our mode of living,
and to provide, by degrees, such indulgences as
befitted our apparent position. You can judge
whether I have kept the promise which I then
made to myself, whether our cherished ideal
of ‘plain living and high thinking’ has been
reached.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here Mrs. Stamford approached her husband,
and placed her hand in his, amid the silent
astonishment which pervaded the company.</p>

<p class='c017'>“I have only now to say that all things
shaped themselves in every respect as I could
have wished. I am the happiest and proudest
father this day in Australia. I can trust my
beloved children, in ripened manhood and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>womanhood, with the full knowledge of their
altered position, and I ask their forgiveness, and
that of my dearest wife, for the apparent want
of confidence involved in this my first and last
secret, as far as they are concerned.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Here Mr. Stamford resumed his seat, and
looked round vainly for any sign of dissent.
Before other comment was possible, his wife
turned towards him with a countenance expressive
of the purest tenderness, the most
loving and perfect confidence.</p>

<p class='c017'>“My darling husband,” she said, “you lay
too much stress upon the reserve necessary for
your purpose. As the head of the family,
you had a perfect right to give or withhold the
information. Have you not always considered
the best interests of us all? You <em>might</em> have
taken me into your confidence, perhaps, but no
child of ours would dream of questioning your
action in this or any other matter. Could we
have been happier with all the money in the
world?”</p>

<p class='c017'>“And so say all of us, my dear old governor,”
said Hubert, walking round to his father’s
chair and shaking his hand warmly, a proceeding
which was quickly followed by Barrington
Hope, Willoughby, and Colonel Dacre. “I
should never have stuck to my collar or been
half the fellow, if I had thought, years ago, that
work or play was optional with us—would
never have tackled the things that now I feel
proud and happy to have carried through;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>never had such a little wife, most likely, either.
In her name, in all our names, I thank you from
my heart for what you did.”</p>

<p class='c017'>Laura’s arms had been for some moments
round her father’s neck; her feelings were too
deep for words; her tears were those of relief
and gratitude. The Colonel made an opportune
diversion by expressing a hope that his esteemed
friend’s whist would now undergo a beneficial
change. His sudden deterioration of form had,
he confessed, caused him, the Colonel, great
uneasiness, even alarm. Now that the murder
was out, and his breast unburdened of its dreadful
secret, he felt confident they would return
to their former most enjoyable social relations.
As a friend, a father, and an antagonist in the
king of games, he begged to be permitted to
congratulate him most warmly and sincerely.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c017'><cite>DAILY TELEGRAPH</cite>—“His chapters in praise of the stout hill
foxes, and the brilliant runs they give over miles of grass and fern,
remind us in their freshness and abundance of life of Whyte Melville
at his best.... The novel is an excellent one.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>GRAPHIC</cite>—“It is long since we have read a novel with so much
unbroken pleasure.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>PALL MALL GAZETTE</cite>—“A very pretty little plot of adventure
and love is woven out of this material. Interspersed, but not too
frequently, are some hunting scenes drawn with great spirit.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>MANCHESTER EXAMINER</cite>—“Reminds us very forcibly of
some of the most characteristic romances of Charles Kingsley and
Mr. Blackmore. The <cite>Queen of the Moor</cite> is like <cite>Westward Ho!</cite> and
<cite>Lorna Doone</cite>, full of nature and of human nature.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>MORNING POST</cite>—“Since <cite>Lorna Doone</cite> the natural features of
an English district have not been described with such a vigorous
touch as is Dartmoor and the country that surrounds it in Mr. Adye’s
novel ... his delightful romance which has the freshness of the
wild moors it so vividly paints.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>DAILY CHRONICLE</cite>—“Lovers of the picturesque in nature will
render grateful thanks to Mr. Adye for the admirable sketches he gives
of romantic Dartmoor.... There is a charm about these descriptions
which reminds us of those of Mr. R.D. Blackmore. We never
tire of them, for they are never twice the same. Each time we get a
new glimpse, and each time we feel more strongly drawn to this land of
heath and tor.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>OBSERVER</cite>—“A work that will rank high among the historical
romances of the present day.”</p>

of the best qualities of Whyte Melville, the breezy freshness and vigour of Frank
Smedley, with the dash and something of the abandon of Lever... His last
volume is one of his best.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>GLASGOW HERALD</cite>—“There is a fresh breeziness about the book which
makes it pleasant reading.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>DAILY MAIL</cite>—“A sprightly book, this is, as much English as Australian, with
a style distinguished by a rattling freedom which rarely degenerates into slipshodness.
The interest is mainly horsey, yet the men and women live and the whole
story goes with a swing and a rush.”</p>

his inventive faculties at their boldest, his constructive skill at its fullest,

<p class='c017'><cite>GUARDIAN</cite>—“These stories are written from personal knowledge of
the Neapolitan peasant class, and in consequence they are most remarkable.
To gain this knowledge, Mr. Grant gathered his material ‘by personal
intercourse with the lower classes in their narrow homes, or in by-ways and
lanes still narrower.’... Such material gained in so intimate a fashion
Mr. Grant has worked up into stories thrilling in their realistic interest.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>TIMES</cite>—“Mr. Grant’s collection of Neapolitan sketches, or studies in
fiction, founded on his peculiar and extensive knowledge of the populace, is
a work of poignant interest.... Full of incident and colour....
The book is one of permanent value.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>MORNING POST</cite>—“Within its limits leaves nothing to be desired for
fidelity of characterization and colouring, and induces regret that a writer
of such varied gifts should have died at a comparatively early age....
The entire volume is vividly descriptive and full of Southern colour.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>DAILY NEWS</cite>—“The book is well worth reading and even studying.
The street scenes are handled with artistic effectiveness, and the people seem
to live before us.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>SCOTSMAN</cite>—“It is not a bare, Zolaesque, photographic picture of low
life that is revealed. The hand of the artist in words, and the touch of the
genial sympathizer with human nature in all its aspects invest it with infinite
charm, and few who take up this book will lay it down without feeling that
Mr. Grant has conveyed in these pages some notion of the fascination which
held him so long in Naples.”</p>

<p class='c017'><cite>GLASGOW HERALD</cite>—“If Mr. Grant has left any other studies of the

country.... So magical is the wilderness environment, so fresh the characters,
so buoyant the life they lead, so companionable, so well balanced, and so

<p class='c017'><cite>PALL MALL GAZETTE</cite>—“Mr. Allen’s power of character drawing invests the

its perusal as one of the new pleasures of their lives.... One of those rare

women, and which afford a gratification that is far greater than that of mere
critical approval. It is, in plain English, a beautiful book—beautiful in language
and in sentiments, in design and in execution. Its chief merit lies in the fact
that Mr. Allen has grasped the true spirit of historical romance, and has shown
how fully he understands both the links which unite, and the time-spaces which
divide, the different generations of man.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

    Chief Executive and Director
    gbnewby@pglaf.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
